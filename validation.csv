21c0bd69b7e7df285c3d1b1cf56d4da925980a68,"A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'","Works include pictures of Presidential Palace and Yangtze River Bridge .

56f340189cd128194b2e7cb8c26bb900e3a848b4,"A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted a year ago of killing his ex-girlfriend's family in a fiery attack on the family home in 2007 .

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game.

ce7460d21ce2336a0a8ee5812edd8b785b71811f,"The team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on Wednesday night. Stoke City beat Everton, to nobody’s great surprise, and look on course for their best Premier League finish yet – a year after their last. Mark Hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this. Manager of the Year? Quite possibly. Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games. His team registered 50 Premier League points in reaching ninth last term, two club records, but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher. Seven wins from 11 in the league have seen Stoke nudge past West Ham United and Swansea – both clubs with claims to good seasons. And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed £1.2million on bringing in new players this season: £800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and £400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica. Mame Biram Diouf, scorer against Everton to take his tally to seven Premier League goals? Free from Hannover. Jon Walters (centre) congratulates Mame Biram Diouf after he scored Stoke's second goal on Wednesday . Phil Bardsley, a regular at right-back with 22 Premier League games? Free from Sunderland. Steve Sidwell, who has been adept when called upon, also cost nothing after leaving Fulham. Victor Moses, whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the Britannia on Wednesday, is on loan from Chelsea. Philipp Wollscheid, who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect, is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer. By contrast Burnley, hardly the most lavish of spenders, have parted with around £8m on transfer fees. Michael Kightly was one of Sean Dyche’s purchases, at £1.5m, from Stoke. Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of £2m – so in all are around £2.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes’s association with the Catalan giants. The player’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes’s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis’s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was £2m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes’s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, £3m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent £6.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let’s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A £10m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes’s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year’ s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.","Stoke City beat Everton 2-0 to move up to eighth in the Premier League .

b5febe3ebb819b1743b6718288b2d93a41193c4f,"A team from a Spanish university . has discovered what Egyptian  authorities are calling the . world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old . skeleton of an adult woman. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the . woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed . 'an extraordinary deterioration'. 'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the élite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen saidthe Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town. But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said . the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the . country's southernmost town. Her remains were discovered in the necropolis of Qubbet . el-Hawa, west of the southern city of Aswan, the ministry said. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research . agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year . in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town (pictured) Other analysis - including examination of the last food found in the stomachs of three horses buried in her tomb - allowed Dr Polesmak to formulate an intriguing account of this woman's final months alive . Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks. Separately from the MRI, academics also conclude she was a virgin who lived a deliberately 'celibate' life.","Woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, country's most southern town .

4a039636bd3f339eceb4f46312d1b2daa4fa3cf0,"A doctor who made a stand against sexism in medicine has received hundreds of messages of support from disgruntled women physicians across the world. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar, posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex, with people regularly referring to her as a 'lady doctor' instead of just 'doctor'. She pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar in Melbourne . Writing on blogspot.com, Dr Witt, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me ""blondie"" or ""Barbie"", every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a ""lady doctor"" instead of a ""doctor"". 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said, ""they shouldn’t send you up here, you’re too clucky"". She continued: 'It’s also the consultant who commented that I’d ""obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty"" (Um, maybe I’m actually good at my job?). 'It’s the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Dr Witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected Australian vascular surgeon called Dr Gabrielle McMullin, who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career. Dr Witt, who says she has faced sexual harassment at work . Dr Witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession. She said: 'These seemingly harmless comments, coupled with the line that we 'need to take a joke', teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment. 'And worse still, they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment. 'Where do we draw the line between commenting on someone's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance? 'Clearly we're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone, so why don't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts.' Dr Witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers, suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question. She said: 'I’m going to ask you,that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out. 'Whether you’re the med student, the consultant, the nurse, the dietician or the plaster tech, that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say ""hey! Let’s not make jokes based on gender"", or ""I don't think that's appropriate."" 'Maybe, just maybe, the tiny ripples of change could start here.' The blog, which was posted on Sunday, has since been praised by thousands around the world. ‏@cathimon wrote on Twitter: Excellent piece.

Referee Craig Thompson sent-off Van Dijk before making a major gaffe when he wrongly dismissed Butcher's Terrors team-mate Paul Paton.

Hoops boss Ronny Deila celebrates winning his first piece of silverware since arriving at Parkhead . That left both men sweating on their places for Sunday's QTS Scottish League Cup showdown at Hampden. But there was relief for Van Dijk and Paton as they were later cleared to play after successful appeals to the Scottish Football Association's disciplinary panel. And it was the Celtic centre-half who was left bearing the brightest grin as his side clinched Ronny Deila's first trophy as Parkhead boss with a 2-0 win at the National Stadium. Van Dijk said: 'It was quite a tough week. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. 'It would have been very disappointing if I'd not been allowed to play on Sunday, especially with it being my first final ever. 'But you know, justice was served and I was able to play. Luckily I got the red card overturned and we did a good job.' The Dutch defender was sent off for a clash with Callum Butcher in Scottish Cup quarter finals . Van Dijk is sent off but was later cleared to play on Sunday following a successful appeal . Dundee United's Paul Paton also had his red card rescinded after being wrongly sent off . Van Dijk has been linked with summer moves to south, with Barclays Premier League high-flyers Arsenal and Southampton monitoring his progress. But for now the 23-year-old is happy to enjoy Celtic's treble chase. 'It means a lot to have lifted the League Cup,' he said. 'It's my first cup trophy ever. 'This club is an amazing place, I have always said that. I have been improving since the day came here. 'That is the most important thing for a player. If you win trophies, that's even better.' Kris Commons fired Celtic ahead midway through the first half before substitute James Forrest stroked home a second 12 minutes from time. The Hoops winger also had time to miss a late penalty as a United side that spent the last 35 minutes a man down following skipper Sean Dillon's red card avoided a heavier defeat. However, Jackie McNamara's team will go for revenge when the sides meet for part three of their four-game duel with Wednesday's Scottish Cup replay. Van Dijk said: 'We made it tough for ourselves on Sunday and should have finished the game faster in the second half. James Forrest celebrates scoring Celtic's second goal before missing a late penalty at Hampden . Scorer of Celtic's first goal, Kris Commons, celebrates with the trophy following Celtic's win . 'One-nil is a dangerous score - if they had scored one goal they would have had the believe to hit us with everything. 'At moments it looked tough but Craig Gordon only had one save to make in the first half and nothing in the second half, so I think we did well. 'It's a big boost for us ahead of Wednesday night. We can go for the second cup now full of confidence. 'They will be up for it on Wednesday night and know they have possibilities with the players coming back in to their team. 'But we need to be ready and win the game.'","Celtic defeated Dundee United 2-0 in Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .

b548af6fff8daaf4f68c71e6c94ab90f1f5d24ff,"An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004. Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said. The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term. However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic. Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction. Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats. Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Former life: Pictured is the gentlemen's club in Birmingham, Alabama, where Miller allegedly worked before fleeing to Thailand . All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree. The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction. However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state. Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October. The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’. Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry. She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York. Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui. He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy. Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea' Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled. Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet. But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.' Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . 'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said. She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV. 'She called me a few months back to say ""Mom, I’m pregnant,"" that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left. 'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in. 'At least I know she's finally coming home.’ Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama . Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004. The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him. Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died . She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month. But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute. A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family. ‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men. ‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter. ‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’ Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’. Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly. They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films. Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic . One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend. 'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes. 'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes. 'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining. According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.' Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby . Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison. With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more. ‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online. ‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life. ‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested on a remote island in Thailand this week after vanishing from Alabama, where she was supposed to be in jail .

57f88e1055acb2b857a378a7c64de2bfd4563658,"(CNN)After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. Another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study, according to a press release from the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. ""We have worked hard to reach this point,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said. ""... If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history."" Patient Zero -- i.e. the first case in the current Ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old Guinean boy who contracted the virus in December 2013 and died a few days later. Since then, the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by WHO have come in Guinea and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). While Liberia didn't have any of these new incidences, Guinea did -- especially in Forecariah and Conakry. Still, authorities in Africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease. The progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases, with January's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic. This positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control, public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices. But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. That's why, over the past six months, WHO has been working with scientists, ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting Ebola in the first place. Health workers in the Guinea trial will start with a new Ebola case and then trace all of that patient's contacts, giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated. John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there ""vital"" to its success. ""The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let our guard down until we reach zero cases,"" WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny said. ""An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.""","WHO leader: This vaccine could be ""the first preventive tool against Ebola in history""
This trial campaign will be conducted in a hard-hit region of the West African nation of Guinea .
Authorities have had success in curbing Ebola, but dozens of new cases still arise each week ."

Silvano Espindola revealed that Falcao phoned him from Old Trafford last week before he was made to play for the Under 21s against Tottenham and admitted he felt ‘weird’ about the situation. The 29-year-old striker also expressed fears that he risked a recurrence of his serious knee injury by playing against lower-grade opposition.

Falcao lined up for United's development side against Tottenham, but failed to make an impact on the game . Falcao is earning £280,000-a-week during his loan to United from Monaco, but it looks increasingly unlikely that Louis van Gaal will sanction a £43million deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season. The former Porto and Atletico Madrid man has only scored four goals for United and has not started a game for three weeks.

We talked for about 20 minutes while he arrived at the stadium and he told me “something like this had never happened to me – I don’t know how to handle the situation, I feel weird!” ‘He was a little fearful because he is afraid of those matches with the youth teams and of the second and third divisions.

9e92dcf4f0b4792ecebf7f6990a7d2b794eb2cb9,"Officers have arrested 21-year-old Matthew Ellery (pictured) on suspicion of theft . A UKIP candidate handed his own son – a Ukip councillor – in to police after discovering valuable stock from his antiques shop had been stolen. Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take Matthew Ellery to the police had been the most difficult of his life. But he added that he hoped it would show he was capable of making hard choices and worthy of a seat at Westminster. Mr Stone is hoping to oust the disgraced former culture secretary Maria Miller in May. The father-of-four admitted he had a 'lump in his throat' as he apparently escorted the 21-year-old to the local police station. Officers arrested Ellery on suspicion of theft. Mr Stone said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do but I would do it again. I took him to the police station, absolutely. I did what I had to do. The police are still investigating.' The grandfather added: 'I made a complaint about stock going missing – whether he stole it from me I do not know yet. I will stand by him when it is all over. He is my son.' Ellery, who controversially won a place on Basingstoke and Dean Council last year, has been released on bail until after the election. Mr Stone, who was announced as Ukip's candidate for Basingstoke last year, said he was hopeful of winning the seat despite the arrest. 'It is a family issue,' he said. 'It could be very positive. The fact that I am willing to take my own children to court if they do something wrong is a positive move. I am capable of taking the hard decisions if they are needed.' Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take his son to the police had been the most difficult of his life . The parliamentary candidate admitted his action had received 'mixed reactions' from the rest of his family, with some even suggesting the move was politically motivated. He added that he had not seen his son, who uses his mother's maiden name, for a week. Ellery's election to his local council was shrouded in controversy, coming as it did after he caused outrage by branding the women in his town 'pug ugly' on social media. He also posted a message on Facebook saying that he 'felt like stabbing someone'. Mr Stone went to the police three weeks ago after finding stock had been stolen from his shop Squirrel Antiques in Basingstoke over the last year. The businessman, who also runs Stone's Fine Jewellery in the Hampshire town, would not confirm the value of the theft but it is believed the items taken amount to tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Stone said: 'The police do not know the exact figure. I know my stock has gone missing over the past year – of course I do.' Hampshire police said: 'The 21-year-old arrested man has been re-bailed pending further enquiries. He's now due to return on bail on May 14.' Basingstoke and Dean Council said it had not been informed of the arrest and Ellery had not been suspended. Ukip refused to comment saying it was a family matter. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ukip candidate Alan Stone, 50, handed son, Matthew Ellery, over to police .

faba1b198798edd16efa476899c836afbf88488d,"A self-driving car is gearing up for  a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip from San Francisco to New York that begins next week. A person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car, developed by Delphi Automotive, in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle cannot handle on its own. The car will begin its journey on March 22 so that it can reach New York in time for the International Auto Show. Scroll down for video . A self-driving car developed by Delphi Automotive is preparing for a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip next week that will take it from San Francisco to New York . Delphi, a major Michigan-based auto supplier, is planning for the car to drive eight hours a day for eight days. The autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways, where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens told WIRED the road trip will be the 'ultimate test' for the vehicle, as it will be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather. It's design is based on a 2014 Audi SQ5. According to Delphi officials, the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in North America. In 2010 an autonomous van created by Italian company VisLab completed an 8,000-mile journey from Europe to Shanghai for three months. Unlike Google's driverless car (pictured), Dephi's vehicle senors are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. Although it will be the Delphi car's longest journey, it won't be its first. The Delphi vehicle has driven around the company's Silicon Valley office and has already completed a trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But the car really earned its stripes when, during a demonstration at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January, it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it. Delphi says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions, like stopping and then proceeding at a four-way stop, merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can. When the car wants the driver to resume control, it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard. Although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away, Delphi's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car. Unlike other driverless cars developed by Google and Honda, the lidar sensors on Dephi's vehicle are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. The car also has cameras throughout, including one that watches the driver. Because lidar systems can cost around $70,000 apiece, they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes. But Delphi engineer Doug Welk said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car, which will ultimately help lower costs. Delphi estimates it will cost around $5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens said the road trip would be the 'ultimate test' for the autonomous vehicle, as it would be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather .","The Delphi Automotive car will drive eight hours a day for eight days .

The company asked for them to be taken down almost immediately after the incident, which killed 150 people. Adverts for Germanwings with the slogan 'get ready to be surprised' are being removed from the London tube network following Tuesday's crash . The adverts, which have a picture of an air hostess as well as images of popular German destinations, said: 'Get ready to be surprised. Visit Germany. 'Enjoy the variety of Germany and fly to e.g. Berlin or Hamburg.' A Transport for London spokesman confirmed they were taking the posters down as quickly as possible. They said: 'Our advertising department was contacted by the company and asked to remove the adverts on Tuesday. 'We had 65 digital adverts that were taken down within an hour.

Well it seems Today show host Karl Stefanovic does, as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts. The 40-year-old gold Logie winner, who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person, is known for being one of Australia's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines, displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses. Scroll down for video . Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on Thursday's Today show . The loveable rogue, who was joined on set by co-host Lisa Wilkinson and fitness instructor Michael Ryan, turned all of Australia into morning people this morning, keeping them entertained as he twisted and stretched in his hotpants. Lisa Wilkinson could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment, claiming she didn't know why all the floor staff were in stitches. As the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine, Karl, who was wearing a pair of Birkenstocks with socks, stretched out his legs. apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin. The 40-year-old took part in a segment abut early fitness routines . The joker got some strange looks from co-host Laura Wilkinson and trainer Michael Ryan regarding his Birkenstocks, which he teamed with a pair of black socks . During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background. Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire. 'That's not pretty, I think we should stand up guys because it's not good TV at this point in time,' the fitness guru said. 'He's like a dog about to walk up on a tree.' Karl did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment . The trainer looked on in confusion as Karl spread his legs in his tiny hotpants . However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display. 'What? If you don't like it look away,' he jokingly said. That's when things took an unsightly turn, as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge. There was no escaping this move for Karl and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty. Twitter users loved Karl's exercise routine, with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long. Another user commented on Karl's disposition during the whole segment, claiming he demonstrated the Australian version of blue steel. However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display . In November, the Today show co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air for a year, to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry. Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background . Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire . Stefanovic's experiment  sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post. Karl, whose funny streak has seen him become one of the biggest names on television, admitted on Wednesday that he once got into some trouble on the Gold Coast. Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, he was asked if he'd ever been in trouble with the law. 'Yeah I got locked up on the Gold Coast once,' he replied, with a shocked Jackie quickly asking what he'd done to land himself in jail. 'I was at Billy’s nightclub…and I went out to the foyer, and there was a big life size poster of [Australian sportsman and former ironman] Trevor Hendy – and I thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it.' Karl explained where it all went wrong and said: 'Well I was so drunk I ran all the way around the block to the waiting police!.'","Today show host Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on TV .

f354360360ab62603c850af203a0484e883fa1fd,"Bosses at trendy clothing firm American Apparel have been rapped for a 'too sexy' advert showing a female model wearing a 'thong bodysuit'. The firm, which has more than 270 stores across the world, regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). In 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts, showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns. This American Apparel advert featuring an underage-looking model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority . And this week, the ASA again banned an advert showing a flame-haired model wearing a £30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints. One person had complained to the ASA saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was 'irresponsible and offensive' as it 'sexualised a model' who appeared to be underage. Bosses at the ASA said that despite American Apparel saying the model was 20 years old, she looked 'youthful' and that the ad was irresponsible. It stated: 'We considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age. 'The model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible. The campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to '[depict] the thong from various angles' 'We considered that readers were likely to interpret the model's expression and pose as being sexual in nature. 'In conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model, we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child. 'We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence.' It added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. 'We told American Apparel (UK) Ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence.' Bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad 'depicted the thong from various angles'. This isn't  the first time that American Apparel has been in trouble for their adverts. Last September, a  campaign for the fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’. Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display. In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’. It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt. The brand launched its Back-to-School range with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ Last year, the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a 'schoolgirl' leaning over a car door . The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show. The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Last January,the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. A storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines.","American Apparel has been told off by the Advertising Standards Authority .

3b4e3959752fb438ed85b7bfd6171485225e5a33,"Coroner Mary Hassell, who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-Semitism . A senior coroner has accused Orthodox Jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies. Mary Hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities. In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, she says she has been falsely accused of anti-Semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ‘volatile’. She says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 Orthodox Jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over. Mrs Hassell believes other families in the North London area she covers are ‘suffering’ because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of Orthodox Jews, whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies. But the Orthodox Jews say they are being ‘traumatised’ by the coroner’s disregard for their beliefs, forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her. Both sides will soon face each other in the High Court in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high-tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post- mortem examination. In a letter to her bosses at Camden Council, Mrs Hassell writes: ‘I look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility, and protect them from bullying, intimidation and the threat of violence.’ But Rabbi Asher Gratt told this newspaper: ‘The Jewish community is increasingly traumatised by Mrs Hassell’s conduct. It’s getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in England – literally. A pair of Orthodox Jews wait for a bus in London. In their faith, they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . ‘I’m actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the UK since the Second World War but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away – or, worse still, a post-mortem autopsy.’ The row has arisen because Jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin. They also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body. But when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial, a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required. This process can take several days. Following years of campaigning by Muslims and Jews – who share many beliefs on burial customs – the Ministry of Justice has agreed that all coroners in London will operate an out-of-hours service from next month. Others in England and Wales already do so.","Coroner Mary Hassell claims she and her staff are in fear of violence .

889d52651ff7b8615b5c681dbf1116c1b88fc6c9,"The biggest impression Grant Elliott had made on world cricket came when he was barged by Ryan Sidebottom during a one-day international at the Oval seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between England and New Zealand. Now he will be remembered for all the right reasons. Elliott, a little known all-rounder born in South Africa but a naturalised Kiwi, played one of the great one-day innings on Tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take New Zealand to their first World Cup final. It led to jubilant scenes at Auckland’s Eden Park, a venue more readily associated with New Zealand’s rugby triumphs than cricketing ones, and breathed life into a tournament in which exciting finishes have been all too rare. Grant Elliott celebrates hitting a six against South Africa to put New Zealand through to the World Cup final . Daniel Vettori embraces Elliott while bowler Dale Steyn lays on the ground after the crucial blow . Elliott, 36, powered his way to what would be a match-winning unbeaten 84 in the Black Caps chase . What a day for New Zealand and what a day for 36-year-old Elliott, who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach Mike Hesson’s inspired choices for this World Cup. Elliott beams as he meets the press after the match . Elliott will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned New Zealand the most nerve-racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a South African team who fell short when it most mattered yet again. And Elliott will surely never play another shot like the six that soared over the short long-on boundary with five needed off two balls from the world’s greatest fast bowler in Dale Steyn. A man who has had a largely anonymous career that has taken in Transvaal, Wellington and Surrey was humble enough to console the stricken Steyn in scenes reminiscent of Andrew Flintoff’s Ashes embrace of Brett Lee in 2005. Then Elliott talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either Australia or India in the final on Sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous World Cup semi-finals. ‘I was looking to hit that ball for six or four,’ said Elliott. ‘I was just going to line it up and it was going over the boundary. It means a lot to the players but you only had to look to the stands to see how much it meant to a lot of people.’ This was glorious vindication for the attacking, modern brand of one-day cricket that New Zealand have been producing under their impressive captain Brendon McCullum with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic. Elliott goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands . Steyn, for many the world's best fast bowler, stands with his hands on his knees as Elliott celebrates . Elliott shakes hands and consoles Steyn as the conclusion of the match at Auckland's Eden Park . The batsman sparked memories of Andrew Flintoff's sportsmanship with Brett Lee in the 2007 Ashes . Elliott has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50-over power and nor has Martin Guptill, who came of age as a limited-overs batsman with his double century in the quarter-final against West Indies. If they can do it, then why not England, if they throw off the shackles and start again in one-day cricket after their embarrassing exit in the group stages? New Zealand were in all sorts of turmoil two years ago when they messily sacked Ross Taylor as captain but what has happened since has been little short of phenomenal, and they will provide the stiffest of opposition to England in both Test and one-day cricket in May and June. Before his semi-final heroics, Elliott was best known for his collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008 . Then captain Paul Collingwood apologised for upholding the appeal that saw Elliott run out after the clash . This was heartbreaking for South Africa, who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion. Yet to use the ‘c-word’ they hate so much would be harsh on South Africa. They fumbled two crucial run-out chances and then saw JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien collide in the deep (above) when Eliott offered a skyer with 14 needed for victory, but were simply beaten by the better team. ‘I really did feel the pressure, it was stressful towards the end,’ said Elliott, who saw New Zealand home in company with the veteran Dan Vettori. That was of little consolation to South Africa captain AB de Villiers, who struggled to contain his emotions after coming off second best in one of the great World Cup games. ‘We wanted to take the trophy home and lift our nation’s hearts but we weren’t able to do that,’ said De Villiers. ‘But life moves on and the sun will come up tomorrow.’","South Africa-born Grant Elliott hit match-winning 84 not out in semi-final .

The animal was tamed after being rescued as a four-month-old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner Emma D'Sylva. Since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging, playing with toys and even walking on a lead. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Emma D'Sylva and Todd the fox, who she rescued as a cub and raised as a domestic pet . The 11-month-old animal accompanies Ms D'Sylva's pet labradors Sky and Oakley on walks, drawing double-takes from other dog-walkers when they see Todd trotting through the local park. He also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden, plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it's feeding time. Emma, 25, from Stanfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., said: 'Todd has been captive-bred so he has never been in the wild. 'I've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners couldn't look after him any more. Canine customs: Todd enjoys going on walks, playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he's happy . Sleeps in a kennel: The 11-month-old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets . 'I get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him. 'He was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead. 'He is very playful with me. He will run up to me wagging his tail when I go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled. 'He will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside. 'We got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed. 'He is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive. He gets on with my two dogs, and wants to play with them all the time. Playful: The fox, pictured in the park with Ms D'Sylva, cannot be let off the lead because he is deaf . School visits: Ms D'Sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them, including Todd, into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them . 'He tries to do what the dogs do but I can't let him off the lead because he's deaf so I can't shout him to come back. 'At first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now. 'If people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently.' Todd also lives with Emma's menagerie of other creatures at her three-bedroomed house including a skunk, a raccoon, lizards and snakes. She takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive-bred animals. Emma, who lives with her partner Steve Johnson, 34, added: 'Todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms. Walking companions: Todd is pictured in the woods with Ms D'Sylva's two labradors Sky and Oakley . 'He's really getting used to things now and I'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him.' An RSPCA spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in England and Wales as long as they were treated well. He added: 'Foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild. 'Anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.'","Todd the fox tamed after being rescued as cub and raised as domestic pet .

50f309d789f0a7a27ca49fb80976b6b34fd084c5,"(CNN)I met Kelly Gissendaner in January 2010 in a nondescript classroom at Metro State Prison for Women in Atlanta. She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is — who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a ""new creation"" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church ""on the outside,"" as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. ""From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger,"" she said in her 2011 graduation speech. ""I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton."" One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life's most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment: . ""There came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. ""Since I couldn't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard ... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn't keep out God."" This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, ""the ruins of the past,"" and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, ""is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation."" I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls ""costly grace."" For Bonhoeffer, ""cheap grace"" is seeking God's forgiveness as a ""cover-up for one's sins, for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free."" In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly's redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the ""theologian of hope"" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God's intended social order ""on earth as it is in heaven"" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope ""revolutionizes and transforms the present.""  It is the hope of the psalmist who ""looks for the goodness of God in this life"" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly's favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: ""I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord"" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly's own words: . ""The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone."" Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly's journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly's life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly's sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly's life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, ""If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope."" We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.","The execution of Kelly Gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs .

Packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory. The factory has annual sales topping $20million as Streit's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide . 'For decades, immigrant Jews and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the Lower East Side, the Jewish Plymouth Rock, to reconnect with their history and, of course, delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor,' said Annie Polland, a historian at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. 'With the Streit's closure, you have a significant chapter of Jewish Lower East Side history closing.' Tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to Jewish immigrants for much of the 20th century. Property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements. The Streit's property, up for sale, is worth tens of millions of dollars. In the neighborhood, the factory will leave behind places like Katz's Delicatessen, Russ and Daughters and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side, according to the New York Times. The pressure of gentrification, however, is not what has caused the closing of the factor, said Alan M. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron Streit, who started the business after emigrating from Austria. 'The reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us,' Adler told the New York Times in January. Worker Aharon Yakov loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine at Streit's matzo factory . This early 1960s photo shows the storefront of the matzo factory at the corner of Rivington St. and Suffolk St. in New York's Lower East Side . Another photo from the early 1960s shows a rabbi, center, supervising the Passover matzo production at the factory, and pictured right is Aron Gross, the great-great grandson of the company founder Aron Streit . For many workers like Adramov, the Streit's factory has provided a steady job for 25 years, in fact, his only job since coming to America from Uzbekistan . The bakery first opened during World War I, serving struggling Jewish immigrants. By 1925, the business moved to Rivington Street, where the original assembly line winds through four six-story buildings — once overcrowded tenements with narrow, rickety stairs that are still used. However, the 48,000-square-foot factory does not live off nostalgia, as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide. The other mass U.S. manufacturer of matzos is Manischewitz, with Israeli imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves. Demand is growing for matzos even among non-Jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives. The old factory simply cannot keep up with demand, said Aaron Gross, head of sales and marketing at Streit's and one of three cousins running the day-to-day operations. 'I'm fifth generation, and if we want this to last another five generations, we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market,' said Gross, the great-great grandson of Streit. 'The name Streit's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since,' says Karen Kriendler Nelson, whose relatives organized a pre-Passover family reunion at the factory. The current Streit's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed. It may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas-fired, tunnel-like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks, inching slowly to the packaging operation. Workers from the Lower East Side factory have already been offered jobs at the new location (above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory) Operations on Rivington Street will continue until the new plant is up and running (above Caballeros loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine) Beyond the 18 minutes, the dough rises, forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the Jews from Egypt, who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their 'bread of affliction.' 'Nothing changes at Streit's,' declared Rabbi Mayer Kirshner, who oversees the factory's kosher certification. Some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former Soviet republics, like machine operator Michael Abramov, who was born in Uzbekistan. He has been at Streit's for 25 years — the only job he has ever had in America. 'I'm not bored. I love this work. This is important. It's our religion, it's the history of the Jews,' said the 61-year-old Queens resident. Operations on Rivington Street will proceed until the new plant is running with state-of-the-art equipment that will speed up production. These are not your great-grandmother's matzos, kneaded and shaped by hand. Mass-produced and machine-packaged, they are a modern effort to preserve tradition. The employees are all being offered jobs at the new location, where Streit's will preserve its motto — 'the taste of a memory.' In the neighborhood, property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements (above the iconic Katz's Deli in New York shares the same neighborhood as Streit's factory) As the factory closes its doors, it leaves behind places like Russ and Daughters (above) and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side .","Streit's matzos factory in Manhattan is shutting down its nine-decade-old ovens by year's end to move to 21st century computerized plant in another part of the New York area .

6c1fb1595a4d6f37c008404157593011641aae22,"Washington (CNN)Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It's a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren't going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party's hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. ""The great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,"" said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Now we're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances."" Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. ""Unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn't a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,"" said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about ""legitimate rape."" Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. ""Democrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight,"" said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""The infighting is so bad that it's not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington."" The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, ""no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers."" That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was ""willing to consider"" entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities, there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder Democratic hopes in Maryland, which hasn't seen a GOP senator since Charles Mathias in 1987. And Mathias, a civil rights advocate and skeptic of Ronald Reagan, was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party. Republicans are also hoping for Democratic carnage in Ohio, where Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election. National Democrats have endorsed former Gov. Ted Strickland for the nomination, but the news did not force P.G. Sittenfeld, an up-and-coming 30-year-old Cincinnati city councilman, out of the race. Democrats are skeptical that Sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against Strickland and Portman, but if he does, his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old Strickland. In an interview, Sittenfeld spoke critically of Portman, calling him ""a 25-year creature of Washington"" who is ""out of touch"" with Ohio. But the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about Strickland's age. ""I fit the mold for new leadership,"" Sittenfeld told CNN in an interview, careful to note his admiration for Strickland and stressing that he is running against Portman. ""If you put together 100 people into the Senate, wouldn't you want at least one person from the largest generation in American history, the most technologically savvy generation in American history?"" Sittenfeld asked. ""How can we invest  in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles?"" As in Maryland, there appear to be no major early-stage differences between Strickland and Sittenfeld on the issues, which again suggests that the Democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else. With a presidential election on the ballot, increased voter turnout is expected to give Democrats a lift in the general election. ""There is an ideological reason for running, but let's not separate that from a path to victory,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Gonzales & Rothenberg Report. ""Primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity. Democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle, specifically in Maryland. The Democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because Maryland is a Democratic state. Lots of candidates see paths to victory and think, 'Why not me? Why not now?' "" And while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines, the contests are not necessarily damaging, Gonzales said. ""Crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that a party can't win."" Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who worked on several top tier Senate races in 2014, said the primaries might boost Democrats. ""Some of those primaries will animate elements of their base, including some donors, more than the general elections,"" he said. But Todd said the rush of primary activity for Democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years. ""I don't see that happening with Democrats as much as it does with Republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as a centrist Democrat anymore, so there won't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries.""","Recently, it's been Republicans who have been in attention-getting, bruising primaries .

057123b34979f7c0bdc7ba28af13c1eb2ec215d9,"The Internal Revenue Service's $10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the April 15 filing deadline. John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. 'As a result, the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CRY POVERTY: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a National Press Club audience that $10.9 billion is too small a budget to guarantee that taxpayers who call with questions hear a voice on the other end of the line . 'TIS THE SEASON: Tax returns for 2014 are due on April 15 . 'That means that six out of every 10 people who call can't reach a customer service representative,' said Koskinen. 'This truly is an abysmal level of service.' Koskinen wasn't ceding new ground in Americans' hate-hate relationship with the IRS. He was arguing that Congress should give his agency more money. 'We are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open,' he said. 'You would think, in fact, we must be selling something like the Apple watch when you look at the lines. This is not a new story this year; it’s just gotten worse.' Overall, Koskinen complained, 'the IRS is now the lowest level of funding since 2008,' resulting in 'fewer audits and collection cases' and costing the U.S. Treasury at least $2 billion in revenue. CAN'T BE ABOLISHED: Presidential canididate Sen. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. In 2013, the last year for which reliable numbers are available, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves. Law enforcement crackdowns have taken 'a lot of the amateurs off the street, but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world,' the commissioner said. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.' The IRS has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees, including one featuring am expensively produced Star Trek parody video. Another bone of contention among lawmakers who set Koskinen's budget has been the practice, now discontinued, of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes. THE IRS, the federal government agency Americans most love to hate, has had its wings clipped by Congress following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats . Rhode Island Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw, who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the IRS, warned the commissioner this year that the House of Representatives nas taken note. 'We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,' Crenshaw told him, because you don’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.' Tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks, but six-month extensions are available. Still, most Americans find America's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax-preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters, leading to frustration and now-legendary resentment. 'The IRS code is longer than the Bible,' Koskinen said Tuesday, 'with none of the good news.'","John Koskinen revealed the startling statistic during a speech at the National Press Club .

1b7fa41fe8546787903a66933c92298127086033,"If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought. Saturn’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet’s unique properties. But using measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet. Scientists in Israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet (shown). Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds. But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate. This is based on measuring its gravitational field, shape and density . The research was carried out by scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s. In 2006, astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes. But an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion. Mercury: 58 days and 15 hours . Venus: 243 days . Earth: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds . Mars: 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds . Jupiter: 9.9 hours . Saturn: 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds . Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds . Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes and 36 seconds . The new method, though, provides what might be the most accurate reading so far. Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The same formula came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Saturn’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike Jupiter - its rotation period cannot be calculated using the magnetic field alone. But verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn. Alternative methods such as measuring Saturn’s radio emissions or wind field, or tracking the planet’s clouds, had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes. The same method came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter (pictured) - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn and come up with the revised estimate . Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown) ‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University. ‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. ‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’ Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The study, published online in Nature, could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system.","Scientists in Israel have revealed new rotation speed for the ringed planet .

001db2e0e30e54bc5effda388ffb51425d018caf,"A New Zealand bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court Tuesday for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar's Myanmar owner and manager, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. Blackwood, who has a seven month old daughter, along with 40-year-old bar owner Tun Thurein and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, have been held in Yangon's notorious Insein prison since their arrest in December. Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . The trio, who all denied the charges, were sentenced to two years in jail for insulting religion through written word or pictures and a further six months for breaching local authority regulations. Both offences carry the punishment of hard labour. They were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants.

VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Philip Blackwood was jailed for two and a half years with hard labour .

Instead, she says the company relies  on a secretive 'shoulder tap' process that allows few women to achieve the top engineering positions. In the legal papers Miss Huang allegedly argues that 79 per cent of Twitter's leadership team is male, according to Mashable. Miss Hiss Huang complained to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured . Miss Hunag is one of Twitter's oldest employees after joining the firm in October 2009. She was put on leave after she raised a grievance with CEO Dick Costolo about her lack of promotion and quit in June 2014. 'Despite being one of Twitter's oldest employees, Ms. Huang's career at Twitter was irreparably derailed for making a complaint, court documents says, according to Business Insider. 'After three months without explanation as to the status of the investigation, or mention of any possible time frame for her return to work, she felt she had no choice but to leave the company for the sake of her career.' She is now seeking other employees at the firm who feel they have been passed over for promotion to join her in the lawsuit. A spokesman for Twitter said Miss Huang had resigned and was not forced out. 'Twitter is deeply committed to a diverse and supportive workplace, and we believe the facts will show Ms Huang was treated fairly,' they said. Miss Huang started her legal action as the case was being heard of Ellen Pao, a former partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, who is suing for sexual discrimination. During the high-profile trial in San Francisco she has claimed she was passed over for promotion because she is a woman. She alleges that she was fired in 2012 after she complained. The firm deny her claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. At the weekend a judge denied a request by lawyers for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to have Pao's demand for unspecified punitive damages thrown out. Judge Harold Kahn said: 'There is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Kleiner Perkins engaged in intentional gender discrimination by failing to promote Ms. Pao and terminating her employment,' the judge said in the one-paragraph decision. Pao can seek punitive damages that could add millions of dollars to a possible verdict in her favour. She is seeking $16 million in lost wages and bonuses. Meanwhile, Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from former employee and program manager Chia Hong. According to the complaint she has filed with San Mateo Court, she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pictured left, and Chia Hong, a former Facebook employee, pictured right,  have put the spot light on gender discrimination in Silicon Valley . A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality. 'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.'","Female engineer Tina Huang is suing Twitter for gender discrimination .

The Cherries were in cruise control at the Goldsands as they secured their third straight victory which condemned the Tangerines to a fifth consecutive defeat. Basement side Blackpool came in search of their first win in eight matches but any hopes were dashed after just 10 minutes. Brett Pitman fires Bournemouth into the lead at Goldsands as he scored a first-half hat-trick on Saturday . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Elphick (Stanislas 63), Cook, Daniels; Ritchie, MacDonald, Surman, Pugh (Smith 62); Pitman, Wilson (Rantie 79) Subs not used: Camp, Rantie, Fraser, Ward, O'Kane .

Referee: Chris Sarginson . Attendance: 10,013 . Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish. Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home. Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing. Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick. Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about. Pitman (centre) runs away in celebration as the Blackpool players watch on in frustration at Goldsands . He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes. A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box. But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes. The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine. Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half. Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick. Blackpool manager Lee Clark instructs his side during the comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth . Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes. Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off. Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go. Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort. The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands. Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick. The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.","27-year-old scored a first-half hat-trick to put 3-0 up at the break .

An Ohio cop has been convicted of animal cruelty for letting his police dog roast to death in his patrol car last year. Sergeant Brett Harrison will not face any jail time. His only punishment: a $500 fine and court costs. The Montville Township officer outraged the community when he left his two-year-old German Shepard Beny in his squad car for four hours with the windows rolled up last September. The dog was found dead in his kennel in the car when Harrison returned. On Wednesday, Judge Dale M. Chase ruled that Harrison was guilty of one of two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. Following Beny's death, Harrison publicly apologized and said he had left the car running with his air conditioning on. He said he didn't mean to leave the dog in a hot car. The temperature when the officer arrived on station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was found. An investigation concluded Harrison violated policy and procedures. The police department suspended him for two weeks without pay and docked him 40 hours of vacation. Montville Police welcomed K9 Officer Beny to the department in September 2013. Beny was trained in narcotics and patrol.  When Harrison returned to the cruiser after leaving him for four hours, he discovered the dog lying lifeless in the rear passenger compartment’s kennel . Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with him 40+ hours a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. He is said to be overwhelmed with grief . Harrison issued a statement expressing his 'deepest apology' to Montville Township and to his 'partner, friend and loving family member Beny.' 'This is a loss that words cannot describe, and it is very difficult for everyone involved,' said Chief Terry Grice. 'There is no doubt that this loss will have a lasting impact on Sgt. Harrison and our entire department.' A statement from the department also said that Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with the dog more than 40 hour a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. Sgt. Harrison was overwhelmed with grief and is taking this loss very hard, the chief added. Sgt. Harrison was found to have violated policy and procedures. He received a two-week unpaid suspension and a loss of 40 hours of vacation . Sgt. Brett Harrison didn’t leave the windows open and the cruiser was turned off; the temperature at the time Harrison arrived at the station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was discovered . Police say Sgt. Harrison has been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department in 2007 . Sgt. Harrison had been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department on Sept. 11, 2007. He came to the department after serving 10 years in the United States Air National Guard, where he was deployed to Qatar during Operation Enduring Freedom. Over the years, he has received awards and praise from law enforcement leaders for his dedication in getting weapons, drugs, and impaired drivers off the roads. The prosecutor for the SPCA of Medina County is reviewing the case to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer. I want to start by expressing my deepest apology to Montville Township, the Trustees, the citizens, the police department, my fellow officers and to my partner, Beny. I'm sorry to bringing this upon everyone. I apologize to the trustees and police department for putting you all in this horrible position. I know that it is an unenviable position to have to deal with a situation as sad as this. I'm also sorry for the sadness and grief that you were put into. Most of all, I want to say I'm sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day. I want you all to know that I will never forget any of this. Once again, I am sorry. Sincerely, .

95ea595c04fad8bf16d9c9ce8d4a484702dc6d5a,"A British singer and her husband have been fired from their roles as judges on New Zealand’s X Factor after humiliating a contestant by launching a tirade that the show’s boss slammed as ‘completely unacceptable’. Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday. Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband’s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode . Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River . She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: ‘Don’t you copy Cleopatra?’ In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original . Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing . Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired . You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: ‘He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. ‘He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, “No, no, no.” He then snarled, “That was so rude” as we both went into the bakery.’ She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed ‘you are such a c***’. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: ‘I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.’ In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer’s letter, writing ‘not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that ""statement"" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?’ Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: ‘Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!’ X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair’s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick. You have no identity... I am ashamed to be here.' Irvine appeared to take the abuse in his stride and said ‘I think I look really good’. Despite Moon having a look that resembles other more famous singers such as Mark Ronson, Olly Murs and Michael Bublé, Kills replied: ‘You look good because you're dressed as my husband.’ Both their comments were roundly booed by the audience. And fellow judge Melanie Blatt, the former All Saints singer, defended Irvine. She told him: ‘Actually, you're dressed better than her husband.’ Mark Weldon, chief executive of MediaWorks, which owns and operates TV3 - the channel that broadcasts the show - said on Monday afternoon the pair would no longer be welcome on the hit reality show. 'Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,' he said. 'While the judges on X Factor are expected to provide critiques of the performances, we will not tolerate such destructive tirades from any of the judges. 'Contestants put their all into this competition and they should expect to receive feedback and criticism that is professional and constructive. 'We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately.’ Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow judge Stan Walker will take over on Monday night. A Facebook group called 'Fire Natalia Kills from X Factor NZ' was created after the show, amassing over 57,500 followers, while a petition demanding the same thing gathered 74,000 signatures. Afterwards Blatt took to Twitter to slam Kills. She wrote: 'Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a t**t.' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Water off a duck's back... Kills tweeted shortly after the show, seemingly unfazed by the petitions and Facebook groups calling for her to be fired . Not happy: People tweeted in their droves about their disgust at Kills and Moon's comments . Not happy: Fans aired their grievances about the insults that were hurled by the pair of judges . You're a t**t!' Fellow judge and former All Saints member Melanie Blatt attacked Kills on social media . Outraged: Blatt could no longer keep her cool and took to her own social media account to speak out about the televised humiliation . Replaced: Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow host Stan Walker will take over on Monday night . Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.

4a7b3f319f2102bebff7657f669a905bf89aeb8c,"In the wake of Manchester City’s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. ‘I wanted to say ‘‘well done’’ to him after his winning goal,’ revealed Fernando. ‘To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.’ Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City’s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' ‘It’s really hard,’ Fernando admitted on Thursday. ‘I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. ‘This season has gone OK, I think, but I’m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. ‘We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won’t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. ‘The criticism will always come if things aren’t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn’t do but that is just what happens.’ City’s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho’s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. ‘It’s not something that would happen in our team,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. ‘We play according to whatever happens and we don’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . ‘Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. ‘At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. ‘But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. ‘It was two great teams wanting to go through. ‘The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. ‘The players were tense and that’s why these things happen. It’s adrenaline and tension.’ On Thursday at City’s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club’s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. ‘In every team and every player there is a need to talk,’ he said. ‘It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It’s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn’t even a tiny bit upset about. It’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.’ Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . ‘It is really hard for Brazil now,’ he said. ‘We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. ‘The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. ‘Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. ‘Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.’ Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): . Isaias Marques Soares, aka Isaias, signed for Coventry from Benfica in the summer of 1995.

A Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation computers can break. Each Bitcoin is a piece of code that has been generated through computer processing, known as 'mining'. Once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash. Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Users choose a virtual wallet  which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. The app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software, which includes the Jawbone UP3 and Mio. As the wearer exercises, the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm then converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins.

Although this is a low amount, the technology is a concept so needs some refinement. Plus the more energy a user expends, the more money they make. As the wearer exercises, the tracker sends heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins .

The current Queensland Reds player pleaded guilty to the downgraded charges, after he had originally been charged with supplying the illicit drug. The fine of $2500 is substantially less than the amount Hunt paid for the drugs, which have a street value of roughly $300 per gram. Later in the afternoon, the Australian Rugby Union came down much heavier on Hunt, hitting him with a six-week ban and $30,000 fine. He also stood down from his position of vice-captain at his club. Scroll down for video . Football star Karmichael Hunt was all smiles as he left court without a conviction, after he earlier pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. Hunt arrives in court prior to pleading guilty to four counts of cocaine possession. All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. Hunt accepted the blame for his actions and apologised to his team and to fans of the game. 'I made a terrible mistake last year and have no one but myself to blame for this situation,' Hunt said in a statement issued this afternoon. 'I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my family, friends, team mates, Reds members, sponsors, fans and the wider rugby and sporting community in Queensland and beyond. Earlier in the day, Hunt said he was 'relieved' with the court's decision. 'I'm looking forward to putting his part of the process behind us and moving on,' he said. Hunt is scheduled to have an official press conference on Friday, but speaking outside of court he was 'relieved with the outcome'. Mr McDougall did not dispute the facts presented by police, and said they were the results of 'poor choices' by his client. 'He'll be paying for those choices for the rest of his life,' Mr McDougall said. 'He has suffered significant economic loss....it's an enormous economic loss. 'This has been a massive, massive wake-up call to him.' ARU boss Bill Pulver expressed his disappointment with Hunt, but said the sport will stand behind the embattled player. 'Illicit substances have no place in Rugby,' Mr Pulver said in a statement. 'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.' The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, from former NRL players.

But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham. The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens. Anthony Robin Ellis as Captain Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza in one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, Poldark . Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees. Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight. 'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says. 'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted. 'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose. Poldark's original creator Winston Graham  was furious with the depiction of character Demelza, pictured is the author's wife Jean Graham . 'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control. 'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.' But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic. Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life. 'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house. 'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.' Remake: The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis . 'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too. Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho. The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters. 'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.' The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series. 'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund. 'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'","Poldark's writer Winston Graham was 'livid' with BBC depiction of Demelza .

Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Scroll down for video . The foundations of an ancient palace in the Assyrian city of Khorsabad which has reportedly been looted and destroyed by Islamic State militants near the Iraqi city of Mosul . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was also investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Yesterday, officials officials  reported the jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said.

Fatally injured: The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body. He is heard begging passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The man died the following day . The explosive blast was also seen by locals at the same time as the electricity cut out throughout the Witbank suburbs. As they rushed over to see what had happened they saw the man smoking and shouting for help as he climbed out of the Botha substation in the city's Lynnvill suburb. According to the local council's acting municipal manager Theo van Vuuren, the thief had probably been attempting to repeat the success of an earlier theft at the same substation. During that incident electrical wiring was stolen leaving the areas of Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity. 'Today a thief attempted to steal and vandalise Botha substation, only weeks ago this same substation was hit leaving Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity,' van Vuuren said. 'The team has managed to restore power to Lynnville and part of Ackerville. After restoring power a cable fault emerged and this is affecting part of Ackerville as well as Thushanang.' He did not comment on the video footage of the young thief that appeared a short while later showing people refusing to assist the man as he screamed in pain and shouted for help. One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: 'The man came out of nowhere and was screaming, obviously in a lot of pain. His whole body was burned, the skin was left hanging off his body and some of his hair also burnt off.' Several community members came out to see why he was shouting but no one wanted to help the poor man. They were all staring at him,' he added. Video of the incident captures locals shouting: 'What were you doing? You brought this on yourself, what were you doing in the substation?' 'I am burning, I am dying and it is so painful, please get an ambulance,' the horrifically injured thief shouted back. According to the source, the man walked 500 metres to the clinic where the nursing staff called an ambulance. He was taken to a nearby hospital but is understood to have died the next day. The local police spokesperson colonel Leonard Hlathi said that they had not had any reports about the theft and the dead man's identity remains unknown.","Young thief was horrifically burnt in the outskirts of the city of Witbank .

Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’.

College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen standing at a bus stop opposite the store. Middlebury police chief Tom Hanley said at a press conference on Tuesday that Durst's name was first connected with the missing girl in 2012, following a tip from a member of the public about him owning the store but who was unaware of his link to Schulze. Investigators searched Durst's former property in the area last year but found 'nothing of interest in this case', the chief told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen at a bus stop opposite the store after buying prunes inside . Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen McCormack in an undated picture. The couple lived in Vermont in the early seventies around the time a teenage girl vanished from the area. Kathleen Durst later went missing in 1982. She has never been found . On the day she vanished, Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was seen at 12.30pm across the street from Durst's store at a bus stop, eating prunes she had bought inside. She was trying to catch a bus to New York City on December 10, the case's lead detective Kristine Bowdish said on Tuesday, but it had already left. The teen returned to her nearby college dorm room at 12.45pm and remained there for ten minutes. At 1pm, her final exam began but she did not attend. At 2.15pm she was seen once again at the bus stop across from the health food store. She has not been seen since. Miss Schulze was last seen wearing blue jeans, a maroon sweater, parka and boots. She was 5'2', around 105lb and had severe acne at the time. All her possessions including her ID were left at her college room. She was not reported missing until December 16 when her parents, who lived in Simsbury, Connecticut, contacted police. Fellow students had not noticed she was missing for several days in the ebb and flow of the end of term. Middlebury Police Detective Kristine Bowdish points to a photograph of the building where Robert Durst owned the All Good Things health food store in the 1970s. The store is near where Middlebury College student Lynne Schulze, was spotted December 10, 1971, the day she was last seen . Her parents had asked that their daughter's disappearance be kept quiet for several weeks. It was finally made public on January 24, 1972. Durst, who owned the Middlebury health store for two years and lived in the area with wife Kathleen, was not questioned in 1971, police said on Tuesday. The original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years. Police admitted there was no indication that Miss Schulze and Durst had ever met or interacted. However Chief Hanley said that Durst was 'a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person' and that they were cooperating with other agencies, including the FBI, for an opportunity to talk with the 71-year-old real estate scion. 'When it involves Robert Durst, it's a broad scope we have to deal with on this,' Hanley said. He added that police had been 'following the news...and trying to get as many memories going as possible'. The student's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide. Chief Hanley said there was 'assumed wrongdoing'. The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing. Robert Durst (pictured left in a court sketch this week and right, leaving a hearing last week) is wanted for questioning by police in Middlebury, Vermont after being connected to a missing girl . The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York . It was not until 2012 that a citizen called Middlebury police and told them Durst had owned the store. Durst, is currently awaiting extradition to California to face a murder . charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx', must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, a judge ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others. Middlebury police said the 2012 tip about Durst did not come from the producers of the HBO show. Both of Lynne Schulze's parents had passed away without ever knowing what happened to their daughter. Her brothers and sisters were 'very interested in the Robert Durst lead', police said. The family has also asked for privacy. Chief Hanley said: 'I've got an 18-year-old woman who disappeared, who didn't deserve to disappear. 'We've kept this case alive for many years and will continue until we bring resolution to her family.' Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued . his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier . this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators . wrongly interviewed him without counsel present. Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los . Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder . of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death . penalty. The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with . evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's . likely killer.

c49eafc214605c4fd905132b879b42954a584273,"Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious ‘fracas’ with a Top Gear producer on ‘personal issues’, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was ‘self-destructing’ and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson’s supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile’s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. ‘I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,’ said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear’s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon’s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking – and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day’s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,’ he said, adding that Clarkson’s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comparison will inevitably anger Savile’s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that ‘it is not just patently absurd, it’s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile’. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. ‘People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,’ said the executive. ‘This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson… . ‘Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.’ Referring to the Top Gear host’s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: ‘It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. ‘If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. ‘The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water… But this is more serious.’ BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One’s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as ‘mortified’. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand – although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn’t have an expensive steak. ‘Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn’t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,’ said one source. Others close to the star – who has been suspended by the BBC – accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering ‘off the rails’. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many – especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive’s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: ‘This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. ‘It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. ‘It’s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.’ Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC’s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a ‘lazy Irish ****’. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: ‘You’ll be on the dole tomorrow. ‘I’m going to make sure you will not have a job.’ The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: ‘ [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. ‘He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don’t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. ‘He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.’ Insiders say the BBC – which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format – is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: ‘You must be freezing.’ The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight’s false exposé of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a ‘friend’ and ‘huge talent’, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ‘heartbroken’. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters’ contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight’s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.","A senior BBC TV executive has launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson .

0fe70fda0a5d2b348605e6c5fc64c5907e84da08,"Mexican cockfighting promoters on Friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen. The annual Texcoco Horse Fair, which takes places on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals. Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition despite demands to ban the 'disgusting' sport. Scroll down for video . Injured birds are given only 15 seconds to recover, even if they are incapable of fighting back, in the brutal cockfights staged nightly during the month-long Texcoco Horse Fair . Razorblades are attached to the birds' left leg to make the fights 'more interesting' for gamblers and trainers . Trainers often spit on a rooster's head in a common technique used to anger the bird before it fights . Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition - even though the 'sport' has been met with furious protests . 'Cockfighting is deeply embedded in Mexico's rural culture', Texcoco tourism spokeswoman Rosalinda Benitez told MailOnline on the opening night of the month-long bloodsport bonanza. 'We want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors'. The event, which includes fairground attractions and one of Mexico's biggest horse auctions, expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month. 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', said Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year. 'This year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights'. While cockfighting is banned in all 50 US states and Europe (it was banned in England in 1835), it nevertheless draws big crowds in Mexico, where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning. Male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers . 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later' The dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent . Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another . A cock struts proudly in the ring, though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down . The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights . Cockfighting is also banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country. Indeed the cockfighting arenas, known as palenques, are often the social hubs of many Mexican towns. 'Cockfighting is a family business', said Gregory Castillo, a gamecock trainer from Ranchito Gaby, one of the eight gamecock-producing ranches competing on the fair's opening night. 'We get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle. It always produces a good party atmosphere'. Gregory had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening, and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of Mexican cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird. 'The razorblades make for more interesting fights', he told the MailOnline as he spat on the rooster's head, a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle. 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later'. The cuurved weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena . Spatters of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring, surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks . The cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena, which is covered in blood from previous fights . 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', according to Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year . The cockfighting areana, known as a palenque, in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration . The weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena. 'It's a disgusting practice and there's no reason that it should continue simply because it's seen as tradition', said Leonora Esquivel, a leader of the AnimaNaturalis animal rights organisation, in a telephone interview with the MailOnline. Leonora's organisation, which works closely with Mexico's  Ecologist Green Party, is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country. The group focuses particularly on bullfights, cockfighting and illegal dogfights which occur periodically around the capital. Each cockfight runs for a maximum of 15 minutes, though most are over within two. Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws is rapid and furious. The male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers. Even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer, it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws, when it comes, is rapid and furious and fights are always to-the-death . The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome . 'Sometimes it comes down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over' A fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor. The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome. The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena, before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ('monkey') gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions. 'The more aggressively they peck, scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona, the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter', said Mauricio Alvarez, an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights. 'But sometimes it comes completely down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over'. Bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress. The high-rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets. The month-long Texcoco Horse Fair also features bullfighting and attracts more than 600,000 visitors a year . The facade of the main cathedral building in Texcoco (left). Mexico's national sport, charreria, is a kind of rodeo made up of different equestrian competitions and is also practiced at the fair (right) Cockfighting is banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but is permitted in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital . For people further back in the stands, tennis balls with slits in them are thrown back and forth between gamblers and bookmakers: stuffed with stakes, winnings and losses. The palenque in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration. Following 16 cockfights, each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket, one of Mexico's most famous bands 'Los Angeles Azules' (The Blue Angels) took the animals' place to play to a packed house. The fair will culminate with three shows by Luis Miguel, one of Latin America's most famous artists and a Michael Bublé-esque crooner, from April 9 to 11. All the shows will follow directly on from the cockfights. In December of last year animal rights activists achieved a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, imposing fines of up to £180,000 on organisations which cannot prove the domestic origins of any animals which are used in their performances. The Mexican government is currently engaged in the struggle to find homes for more than 2,000 repossessed tigers, lions, elephants and other such animals which have been freed as a result of the law. International supermarket chain WalMart was in trouble late last year as shoppers complained that a store in Veracruz state hosted a cockfight in order to promote a soft drinks company.","Annual Texcoco Horse Fair takes places on eastern fringes of Mexico City .

According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a small difference, but the lower oxygen levels in the plane's pressurised air can lead to minor oxygen deprivation in travellers. This could cause light-headedness, shallow breathing or difficulty concentrating. If this happens to you, be sure to alert a flight attendant, as he or she may be able to provide you with additional oxygen or even increase the overall airflow to the plane. The lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation, which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you're cramped in your seat. Ideally, walk around the aircraft every 30 minutes, or, at the very least, flex and stretch your feet regularly. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity . DVT . Deep vein thrombosis (or DVT) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs, causing pain and swelling. Occasionally, it may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. Anyone sitting for more than four hours, as most people do during long-haul flights, is at risk of developing DVT, however, certain groups may be at greater risk. Virgin Atlantic encourages anyone aged 40 or over, anyone with a family history of blood clothes or anyone being treated for cancer, heart failure or circulation problems to be especially cautious. To help prevent clots, moving around during the flight and wearing support stockings will both help to keep blood circulating. However, if you begin to feel short of breath, experience chest pain, or if your legs are still swollen after the flight, you should seek medical attention immediately. On long-haul flights, your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays, energetic particles from space, is higher . Radiation exposure . While on international flights, you're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays, which are energetic particles from space, mostly made up of protons. The longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the North Pole, the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience. While it's of most concern for those who fly for a living, frequent flier passengers will experience more of this exposure than people who spend more time on the ground. Several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population, although a recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) report did not find further support of such a claim. However, the CDC does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you cannot see or feel it, often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed. Flying roundtrip from New York to Los Angeles, for example, three times per year, would expose passengers to the equivalent of 3 chest X-rays, or about 100 microSieverts. On a roundtrip flight from New York to Beijing, however, you can easily exceed that amount. Sun damage from UV rays . It is not something passengers would necessarily think to do before a flight, but applying suncream could well protect against UV damage in the skies. 'At high altitude, over 54 per cent of UVA rays penetrate glass, making pilots spending long periods in the cockpit up to twice as likely to develop melanoma,' Abi Cleeve, MD at UltraSun UK tells MailOnline Travel. 'In fact, 56.6 minutes in the air is equivalent to 20 minutes on a tanning bed.' When flying, a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane . Common cold . Finally, and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers, those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold. A 2004 study in the Journal of Environmental Health Research found that when you're flying, your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you're not on a plane. Take proper precautions and be sure to wash your hands frequently, and carry anti-bacterial hand sanitiser, when globe trotting. After all, the last thing you want is for a simple cold to slow you down on your next glamorous getaway.","When it comes to flying, there are plenty of health concerns to look out for .
Due to the lack of cabin air humidity, dehydration and swelling are common .
Cosmic radiation is also higher when in flight and closer to the North Pole ."

Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at a whopping 56 pounds — about the size of four or five miniature dachshunds. A series of 'before' photos show Dennis resting on rolls of fat, his head seemingly too little for his blob of a body. He couldn't take more than a few steps without being out of breath. Scroll down for video . In this June 2013 photo, Dennis, a dachshund, rests on the ground in Columbus, Ohio. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at 56 pounds and could walk only a few feet without stopping, out of breath. But then Burton rescued him from his previous owner and provided him with a proper diet, exercise and affection . pictured on February 25, Dennis now only weighs 12 pounds and can freely play in the snow. He has had three skin-removal surgeries to remove the folds of excess skin . Then Brooke Burton adopted him from a relative who had fed him White Castle burgers, pizza and other human food, and didn't pay much attention to the dog's burgeoning belly. Burton, a 26-year-old nursing student, recalls how emotional she became when she first saw Dennis in June 2013, and then persuaded her relative to give him up. 'Out comes Dennis, and I couldn't believe it,' Burton says. 'I wasn't even sure what breed of dog he was supposed to be because he was so large.' Burton put him on diet of dry dog food, plus lots of walks and affection. Now the 6-year-old wiener dog is a svelte 12 pounds and happily chasing squirrels in the backyard, playing fetch and bossing around the other three rescue dogs that live with him. 'In the beginning, you could tell he was very depressed, that he really didn't feel good at all,' Burton says. 'He didn't have much of a personality. After he lost weight, this bossy little demanding man popped out. He's into everything, he wants to play with everybody.' Dennis lost so much weight that he started tripping over the folds of excess skin that were left over and getting infections. He has had three surgeries at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center to get rid of it. The operations cost more than  $2,800 together and were covered by a GoFundMe page set up by Burton, donations from individuals and the OSU Veterinary Medical Center, according to  the Columbus Dispatch. Dr. Kathleen Ham, the veterinary surgeon who performed the operations, says Dennis' story is a good lesson for pet owners who might feed their animals too much. 'We have an expression: Food is not love,' Ham says. 'Most of what your pet wants from you is affection and attention.'","Dennis the miniature dachshund lost  75 percent of his body weight .

742163e2d890b106ef93dcee1354deea845db7f4,"(CNN)British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. ""Just don't allow it. It's wrong. It's so wrong. Be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong."" The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook's headquarters in London on Sunday, March 8, to talk about gender equality as part of International Women's Day celebrations. CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world --as the 24-year-old UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma's Facebook moment . Of the dozens gathered at the event, the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike Harry Potter himself. Describing the ""surreal"" moment she gave a speech at U.N. headquarters, later watched by 17 million, Watson said:  ""Gender equality historically has been a woman's movement. ""And how it's affecting men hasn't been addressed,"" she told moderator Greg James. During the hour-long conversation, Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ""I love having the door opened for me, isn't that just polite?"" she said. ""But I think the key is, would you then mind me opening the door for you?"" ""Chivalry should be consensual."" And it's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too, she added. ""I get disturbed by this idea that men can't cry,"" she continued. ""They can't express themselves and I think that's the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it's not what makes you a girl."" When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress, following her UN speech, she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ""If they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite,"" she added. Almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U.S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt Damon. ""I read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO,"" said Watson, adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ""I asked my younger sister: 'What would be the one thing you'd want from boys in your life?' She said: 'I just want them to play with us.' And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included."" Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother, Jacqueline, who was a ""single working mother and type one diabetic."" ""She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good,"" said Watson, adding: ""She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention... I think I failed a Latin exam."" Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ""Why are women not directing their own stories?"" she said. ""The human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped,"" said Watson, paraphrasing famous American feminist, Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change, the actress said it wasn't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones. ""It's everyday, it's individual, it's on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""Whether it's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue."" In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave. She answered: ""I don't think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field.

7f66b15837d7ff3331d15386a5ed4b97fcea908b,"The father of murdered bride Anni Dewani has today marked what would have been his daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was fixing a lift when it plunged to the ground, ripping his right arm off. He underwent a 13-hour operation to reattach his limb after being airlifted to hospital in Gothenberg, Sweden. Today, Mr Hindocha posted a picture on Facebook of himself with two nurses and wife his Nilam, a cake and treats to mark Anni's birthday. She was 27 when she was shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa. 'Celebrations': Vinod Hindocha marked his murdered daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. He posted this picture with two nurses and his wife Nilam (left) on Facebook . He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday little Angel. Miss U for ever. We R celebrating this Birthday In Gothinburg  hospital,love U for EVER’ Mr Hindocha was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However, his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. His brother Ashok, 54, told MailOnline that Mr Hindocha had recovered some movement in his fingers, but will not make a full recovery for at least 18 months, if ever. Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor . He added: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'Nilam and Vinod have had a very difficult few months. 'They are such a strong couple, they will get through this aswell. But it is a lot for anyone to go through. 'We are grateful that he was in Sweden and could get to hospital so quickly and into surgery to try and save the arm. Only time will tell whether the operation will be successful. 'Today is Anni's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband, Shrien Dewani, 35, through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) However, he also said Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case, the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.

e866e771f1f0c8d7ee2b271cfce62e6d6a7aafa2,"(CNN)Team Cookie or Team Boo Boo Kitty? If you're a fan of the hit TV show ""Empire,"" you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series. If you aren't a fan, you may soon be in the minority. The show has become something of an industry phenomenon, with ratings growing every week. According to Variety, two weeks before the season finale, which is set to air on March 18, ratings were up 53% from its January 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45%, from 9.9 million to 14.3 million. Eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard-of these days in broadcast TV, which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services. But Fox's ""Empire"" is doing the damn thing. The show revolves around the character of record label owner Lucious Lyon (played by Terence Howard) and his family, which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what's hers. ""You're so beautiful,"" Empire, and here are some of the reasons why: . Taraji P. Henson . Henson has been in the industry for a minute, and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), her career hadn't really taken off. Not so now. Henson has sunk her teeth into the role of Lyon family matriarch Cookie. The character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely, even as she is also motivated by making money. The show's co-creator, Danny Strong, told Entertainment Weekly that fans can thank Henson for the now infamous ""Boo Boo Kitty"" nickname that viewers have come to love. When Cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband Lucious' new lady love, Anika Calhoun (played by Grace Gealey), ""Boo Boo Kitty,"" you want to yell at the screen, ""Get her, Cookie!"" ""So, basically Taraji is a genius,"" Strong said. ""She's a comic genius, but she's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress, and we're utilizing all that in Cookie."" Watch for Henson to snag nominations next award season. It's old school soapy . Think ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas"" for the 21st century. It has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious: sex, scores to settle, family tensions, violence and did we mention sex? Set in the world of the music industry, there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy, dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode. That's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that ""and then what?"" itch. It's new-school hip . ""Empire"" has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern. One of the primary story lines has been about homophobia, as Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal (Jussie Smollett) battle over Jamal revealing he's gay. It comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights. Series co-creator Lee Daniels, himself an openly gay man, has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community. ""Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community, and men are on the DL (down low, meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women). They don't come out, because your priest says, your pastor says, mama says, your next-door neighbor says, your homie says, your brother says, your boss says (that homosexuality is wrong),"" The Wrap reported Daniels saying during the Television Critics Association press tour in January. ""And they are killing African-American women. They are killing our women. So I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community."" The music is off the hook . The show has managed to improve on what ""Glee"" did and succeed at what the now-canceled NBC drama ""Smash"" tried to do: fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry. Smollett has been the breakout star in this area. His mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack's more popular tunes, including the anthem to individuality, ""Good Enough,"" which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service Spotify. Superproducer Timbaland (best known for work with artists including Jay Z and Justin Timberlake) and his protegee Jim Beanz are responsible for the show's sound. Beanz told Rolling Stone the music has to be authentic and original. ""One of the things that Tim told me is, 'If it sounds like something you've heard before, don't do it,' "" he said. Of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on iTunes. Fingers crossed for a possible ""Empire"" tour featuring Smollett and other co-stars including Bryshere Y. Gray, who portrays youngest Lyon son Hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker Yazz the Greatest. The awesome guest appearances . You could have knocked us over with a feather when Courtney Love popped up on the show. Love had a bit role on this first season, as has supermodel Naomi Campbell and '80s actor Judd Nelson. The series has been hyping appearances from music stars like Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige and Patti LaBelle. Given the popularity of the show, there's no telling who will pop up on season 2. Henson and Howard . The love/hate relationship between Cookie and Lucious Lyon is everything. They have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite. Chalk it up to the longtime friendship between Henson and Howard, who also co-starred in the film ""Hustle and Flow."" Howard told BlackTree TV that he and Henson had to do a ""chemistry read"" to show that they clicked. The end result has been magical. ""We have so much fun,"" Howard said.","""Empire"" has seen its ratings grow every week .
Taraji P. Henson's character is a favorite .
The music is a big part of the show ."

Jennifer Muhm (left) and Malorie Catchpole (right) said they came up with the idea of buddingSTEM after experiences they had with their own daughters . 'We're not anti-princess. We're not anti-pink. We're not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,' Muhm, 37, of Shoreline, Washington, told ABC News. She said her now-five-year-old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013, but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume. 'She looked at me and said, 'I can't be an astronaut. They're only for boys',' Muhm told ABC. After seeing pictures of Sally Ride, Joan Higginbotham and other female astronauts, however, her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut, according to the moms' Kickstarter page. Muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween, but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs . Muhm and Catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls' clothing, including space ships, dinosaurs and trains . Muhm told Catchpole, 34, also of Shoreline, about the issue and they were both frustrated. Catchpole told ABC that her three-year-old daughter is 'very into trains' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train-themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for Christmas, they could only find boy's underwear. Catchpole bought them anyway. 'I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys' underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,' Muhm said. 'I said, 'You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them… and then we thought why just underpants: There are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls',' she added. The women, who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear  for girls between 18 months and eight years old . BuddingSTEM - STEM standing for science, technology, engineering and math - was registered as a business in April 2014. Since the business's origination, the moms have raised more than $52,500 for the company through a Kickstarter . And so the pair filed their business registration for buddingSTEM in April 2014. 'If there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it,' said Muhm. With help from a textile designer and a Kickstarter that helped them raise $52,500 to date, the clothing line will be available in July. 'One of the things that I'm happiest about… is what I think we've shown our daughters,' Catchpole said. 'We're two working moms. We don't have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.' The clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed-and-matched with train, space and dinosaur themes. Clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray .

When a photograph of Labour leader Ed Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy' Like Mr Miliband, the overwhelming response to Mr Clegg was 'weak'. The Lib Dem leader has seen his party's popularity collapse since entering coalition five years ago, in large part as a result of the broken promise to abolish tuition fees.

In a sign that not everyone knows who he is, or is unsure what to feel about him, the top 10 is completed by 'idiot', 'nothing', 'who?', 'OK' and 'unsure'. Two people described the Deputy PM as a 'poodle', four said he was a 'sell-out' and one branded him a 'tosser'. One called him a 'slag', another said 'numbskull' and two said 'pillock' Popular responses to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg included 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless' The overwhelming reaction to Mr Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Ukip has been dogged by revelations about its candidates and members, with Mr Farage insisting he will take action against those who embarrass the party. But he has also courted controversy by defending a candidate taped mocking 'poofters', referring to a Chinese woman as a 'Chinky bird' and threatening to 'shoot peasants'. The next most frequent reactions to Mr Farage included 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot'. The top 10 responses also included 'untrustworthy', 'honest' and 'joke'. Five people said 'frog', five said 'yuk!' and another five replied 'w*nker'. The overwhelming reaction to Ukip leader Nigel Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Others called him an 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot' Daisy Powell-Chandler, a consultant at Populus, said: 'It is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public aren't paying attention most of the time. 'Voters have families, jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today's policy launch or staged visit.' As the election approaches on May 7, more information will start trickle through. 'But many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) based on how each party leader scores on the 'blink test' – the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media. This poll shows precisely that. 'It is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides. People think Cameron is arrogant, Miliband is weak, Clegg cannot be trusted, and Farage is a racist. 'But the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them: Cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent – an assertive leader. 'Ed is weird but caring and intelligent. Clegg is the likeable liberal and Farage a charismatic, funny man. 'Over the course of the campaign, the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next Prime Minister is.'","Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage subjected to 'blink test' polling .

Ms Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer. Ms Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar, told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers. 'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said. Scroll down for video . I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson told Daily Mail Australia many bloggers are 'not taking on board the responsibility' that comes with publishing . Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson last week said she would issue an explanatory statement, but it has not materialised . 'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey. 'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities. 'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information. 'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' Ms Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'. Ms Gibson has stayed mum about her health since admitting in an interview with The Australian that her previous claims cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, uterus and liver may have been a 'misdiagnosis'. In the weeks since doubts were raised about Belle Gibson's cancer and charitable donations, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books . In the weeks since, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia last Tuesday, Ms Gibson said she understood why many of her followers were upset, but she criticised the 'maliciousness' of some critics. She said she would release a statement addressing concerns about her, but that it was 'taking longer than anticipated' due to 'constantly arising issues' and articles she needed to stay on top of. Asked if the statement would address concerns about her medical history, she said: 'Of course, and every which otherwise possible.'

aa11f5cdb7409f40dd89c5b560819a6b2f1bbd46,"A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been  introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price . A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

So perhaps it is unsurprising that Egyptian architects have taken inspiration from the Pyramids at Giza to create a new skyscraper in the capital Cairo. Plans for a spectacular addition to the city's skyline have been unveiled and the shape will look very familiar - not only is the pyramid building borrowing from Ancient Egypt, at 200 metres (656ft) tall, it will be taller than the Great Pyramid itself and the highest building in the country. Scroll down for video . The Zayed Crystal Spark project will feature not one, but two pyramid shaped features. The smaller pyramid at the front will boast an impressive entrance and walkway, surrounded by cascading waterfalls . The Great Pyramid is thought to have been built around 2550BC and reaches 147 metres (481ft). There are three pyramids at Giza - built as burial chambers for three important kings, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - and they are famed as one of the original Seven Wonders of the World. The modern project will be known as the Zayed Crystal Spark, occupying a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district. It will be multi-purpose and have potential to be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures. The development would be created by real estate developers and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA). The Ministry of Housing have announced plans for a spectacular 200 metre high pyramid skyscaper, which will be the tallest building in the country. The shining pillar will be adorned with a glowing capstone and commemorate the nation's prized landmarks .

e98f71ab88cf1951cd53549071672dd62cdd02a3,"Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound . Scientists in the U.S. have devised an implant in a tiny silk 'purse' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body. Up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the UK will develop an infection, and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days. Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations, according to a study published last month. Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound. The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment, including further surgery. The new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria. It consists of a tiny, magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein, and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection, the implant can be switched on using a remote control. This raises the temperature of the coil. The silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight. This is an improvement on previous medical implant devices, which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed. Researchers at Tufts University have used the implant in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes. Within 24 hours the tissue was infection-free. The device, including the coil, completely dissolved after 15 days. 'This is an important step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely,' the researchers said. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual ""wi-fi"" drug delivery.' The team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Stella Vig, consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection. This new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device . The concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new, and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues. These required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely. 'This new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device, which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it. 'Surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery.' Meanwhile, a team at the University of South Florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, which kills thousands of people worldwide each year. The bug is a form of Staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics. The new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines, which have been used in treating malaria and cancer. They have recently been shown to act on bacteria, too. 'In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin, our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections,' said Dr Lindsey N. Shaw, whose team developed the new drugs. 'Bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly. 'We need new drugs to fight these infections.'","Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions .

A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud which she was later cleared of. She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 .

She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations.

0ed40867896644f7d67fa2a21c99cb03425d8b5d,"It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear. As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six. Click here to read Dominic King's full match report . Host commentator . Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match. Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own. Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders. Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible. Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second. Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon. Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game. Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League. A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league. The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points. The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today. Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters. As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through. Everton are starting to get a real grip on this game. Ryan Taylor received a yellow card for bringing down the marauding Lennon. Good atmosphere inside Goodison Park, none of the tension that made the first 30 minutes of the Europa League contest with Dynamo Kiev so uncomfortable. Everton have had the better of the play so far and look fresher, thanks to Roberto Martinez making five changes from that 2-1 win on Thursday. It’s a big game for Everton and they look primed to get the result they need particularly now that James McCarthy has given them the lead. Lukaku holds the ball up before laying it on to McCarthy who scores his first goal of the season with a driven shot at goal. Krul committed himself to diving to his right, however McCarthy sent the ball in the opposite corner. Both sides have failed to really trouble the opposing goalkeeper in the first 17 minutes of the match. Newcastle are just shading the possession stats. Martinez will also need help from his goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has not been in the best of form this season. The former Manchester United man will surely take confidence in his early save. Everton's last home win in the Premier League came back in December when Martinez's side beat QPR 3-1. The Toffees will surely have to improve their home form if they cant to climb the table and ensure they are not involved in a relegation scrap. Lukaku, who found the back of the net against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday, stings Krul's gloves with a powerful shot at goal. He will be desperate to live up to his price-tag and help Everton pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle have started the match extremely brightly. Obertan tested Howard with a powerful effort before Williamson's shot was cleared off the line. Everton: Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Coleman; McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Osman; Kone, Lukaku . Newcastle: Krul; Janmaat, Coloccini, Williamson, R.Taylor; Colback, Sissoko; Obertan, Gouffran, Ameobi; Riviere . The attention switches from the top half of the table to the bottom half where Everton are in desperate need of a win. Roberto Martinez's side are currently just three points away from the Barcalys Premier League drop zone. Newcastle, on the other hand, are sitting comfortably in mid-table. Everton will look to pull clear of the relegation zone in the Premier League with three points against mid-table Newcastle at Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's side have struggled this season - a surprise given their impressive fifth-placed finish last year - and are currently only three points away from the bottom three. Newcastle, on the other hand, have been secure in mid-table for the majority of this season. They have dropped away from the clubs towards the top of the league, but still find themselves 10 points away from the relegation zone. Three points against Everton would almost certainly secure their Premier League status for another season.","James McCarthy scored past Tim Krul in the 20th minute .

Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.","EXCLUSIVE: Scott Rogers was shot dead by his ex-lover  in August .

fb14b821975891645cd8c781da001709d19d746d,"I'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years. Most of my friends hint, imply or say it's my fault for being too shallow, picky and prone to falling for bad boys. I use Tinder, the dating app synonymous with casual sex, to meet attractive men who meet my high standards. Yvette Caster, 33, had been single for four years, before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on Tinder for a week . It's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they can't even message you. If you like them you swipe right and, if they feel the same, you can chat. Most of the time I swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old (over 35), too young (under 25), too dull (into sport), too much of a party animal or simply too ugly. But, after another friend accused me of being picky, I decided to see what would happen if I swiped right to ALL men on Tinder for a week. Here's what happened. Sunday . The first day is the worst. Within a few minutes I've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos, a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants. After an hour I'm exhausted, depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80, mostly unsuitable, suitors. Monday . I get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer, a Ricky Gervais double and a range of football logos (you can put any image as your profile picture). Then a message from Tinder appears. They've noticed my promiscuous swiping and I can't 'like' another man for another 24 hours. Why would I want to? I've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am. After the first day of swiping right to all men, the London-based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages, all before 9am . Tuesday . I have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being 'too picky'. The fact they want to talk to me is a revelation. I usually have messages from two men a week, tops. Of the 22, a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice, down to earth guys. It's just a shame so few of them can spell. I haven't messaged any of them first, either, as I prefer them to do the chasing. Wednesday . It's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous. Keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing, especially when so many men are called Dave. At times I copy and paste the same message to all the guys, which is rude but it's either that or no reply. I can't quite believe so many of them are being so polite. My normal Tinder experience, picking only the hot guys, is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos. Maybe I really could find a boyfriend this way after all. Tinder clocked on to Yvette's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from 'liking' anyone else for 24 hours . Thursday . The chats have gone so well that I've given my number to three men, although I'm still doubtful about whether I could be physically attracted to them. On the one hand, this whole thing feels slightly immoral, or at least an exercise in leading men on. But on the other, if I think about my exes, I'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour, not looks. Friday . I've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates, not hook ups. One guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend. Another, who is far too young really, has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts. I'm starting to think this is the way forward. The 33-year-old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick-up lines (left), whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships . Saturday . Just because I can, I go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards (yuk), men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to Star Wars screen grabs. I also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for. In the end, none of them prove to be The One, but I did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation. Would I do it again? Why not? Some men need a chance to win your heart while others, well, they're just very bad at choosing profile pics.","London-based journalist, Yvette Caster, has been single for four years .

f411fef31493f612945f2cb1c2a5d56312083bf9,"A Los Angeles attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life, in a case that echoes that of Brittany Maynard. Terminal: Christy O'Donnell, 46, is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity . Christy O'Donnell, a former police officer, says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which has masticated into a golf ball-sized tumor in her brain. Despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last June, the 46-year-old has been told her death will be painful, as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her. 'I think it's a terrible injustice that I don't have the choice to die in the manner I want to and instead that I'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and I might even die alone,' O'Donnell told People magazine in a new feature. O'Donnell is now using what time she has left to support a  Death with Dignity law in California, having been inspired by Maynard, the 29-year-old California woman who moved to Oregon to take her own life last year, ending a long battle with brain cancer. O'Donnell says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in Valencia, with her 20-year-old daughter, Bailey Donorovich, holding her hand. She says her greatest fear is that her daughter will come home one day and find her mother dead. O'Donnell said she went to the doctors last year after waking up one morning and not being able to read properly. A big book worm, she had been reading before going to bed the night before, only to wake and hardly make out the letters of some words. She had her eyes checked, but the results came back fine. O'Donnell then called her physician and explain what happened, and the doctor told her to immediately go to the emergency room. Legacy: Brittany Maynard, 29, moved from California to Oregon - one of five U.S. states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in November . An MRI and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis. 'Bailey grabbed my hand and I just started crying and said, ''I'm so sorry'',' O'Donnell told People. 'What I was really saying was, ''I'm so sorry I'm going to die and leave you without a mom''.' O'Donnell underwent chemotherapy and has taken part in numerous clinical trials. However her prognosis has not changed. 'There is not anything medically we have not explored,' O'Donnell said. 'So it is not like I haven't exhausted all my options. My opinion is an informed one.' Doctors say the tumor in O'Donnell's lungs causes fluid to build up. She will soon have to undergo a painful procedure to empty the fluid, however it will fill up again almost immediately. 'There's a good likelihood (my daughter) will come home from work, come home from school, and find me dead,' an overwhelmed O'Donnell told People TV. In memoriam: Three California lawmakers are promoting right-to-die legislation with the family of Brittany Maynard (pictured with husband Dan Diaz), a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under Oregon law on November 1 . Love: Brittany Maynard and Dan Diaz married at the Beltane Ranch in California's wine country on September 29, 2012 . O'Donnell is now hoping to fight not just to stay alive until Brittany's 21st birthday in June, but for the law to allow her to die the way she wants. 'In the short amount of time I have left, I want to spend it with my daughter - she and I are doing this together - and I want to speak out in whatever way possible to start that dialogue with the public, with the legislature and the courts, and try and impact change,' O'Donnell said. O'Donnell's case is incredible similar to that of Maynard. Her family - lead by mother Debbie Ziegler - are now trying to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon, where Maynard moved before her suicide on November 1. Hoping for change: Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on Wednesday January 21, 2015, in Sacramento . The 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman had made her case public with online videos, saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life-ending drugs in California. 'Most Californians would not be able to do what we did,' Ziegler said. 'They couldn't leave their homes; they couldn't leave their jobs; they couldn't leave their families, their friends, their pets. 'We had to do all of that. It added another layer of pain.' Maynard wrote in her final Facebook post: ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more .","Christy O'Donnell, 46, diagnosed with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in June and given six months to live .

31aeaa9d37af35d148aa7b8ecedd9cbafda96338,"Michael Vaughan believes Alastair Cook is 'clearly bitter', and must set aside his own World Cup disappointment for the good of his England team at the start of their Ashes year. Cook claimed on Wednesday that England's decision to replace him as captain with Eoin Morgan, at the 11th hour before the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, was proved 'probably wrong' by subsequent events. England made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of Bangladesh, before the knockout stages were under way. Alastair Cook was replaced as Engtland's one-day captain before this year's World Cup . Former captain Vaughan interprets Cook's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50-over role because of his continued poor batting form. Cook will nonetheless lead England in three Tests against the West Indies, on a tour starting early next month, before returning home to face first New Zealand and then Australia this summer. BBC pundit Vaughan said: 'He's clearly bitter. 'I think that's a bad mentality to have, when you think he's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks' time.' Cook led England to a Champions Trophy final on home soil two years ago, and the top of the world rankings, but their recent one-day international record under him deteriorated. Vaughan added: 'Alastair Cook's last six captaincy jobs in (ODI) series for England, he lost every single one. 'The only series they've won was away in the West Indies, when he wasn't the captain.' Michael Vaughan claims Cook is 'bitter' about the decision to replace him as captain . Cook could only watch from afar as England beat only Scotland and Afghanistan in their World Cup campaign under Morgan, but he sensed they were 'shell-shocked' and in need of 'real leadership'. Vaughan argues Cook must move on, and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record-breaking career. 'I don't think it's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he's clearly bitter. 'He's got to clear that out of his head, because it's so important that by the time he gets to the West Indies England need him scoring runs. 'He has to score runs in the Caribbean; he has to get runs against New Zealand - so by the time the Ashes arrive in July, no one is talking about Alastair Cook's position in the Test team. 'He hasn't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years. That has to change in the West Indies.'","Alastair Cook was replaced as England's one-day captain .

b2a1f80918967220f3e85055603953f52495c81e,"A cannabis-smoking supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook. Mansoor Miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him. The 22-year-old from Kilburn, north west London, even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her Nintendo DS to access Facebook. He was spared jail after a court heard how Miah, who has shared several of Choudary's fundamentalist tweets, struck up an online conversation about the Koran. Mansoor Miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media . When she told him she was uninterested in religion Miah, who worked in Tesco, carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was. He was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at Southward Crown Court today. Earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about Islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction. 'Having talked about Islam, undeterred, Mr Miah began to chat the complainant up,' prosecutor Stephen Requena said. 'Having talked about Islam he proceeds to chat her up, having established her real age. 'He praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend.' The court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself, urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam. He was arrested last year after one of the girl's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a Premier Inn in Kent. 'The mother, it seems, was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered. The 22-year-old is a supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary having shared some of the cleric's posts on Twitter . 'She describes her daughter as not that mature, which leaves her vulnerable,' added Mr Requena. The youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting Miah. In a statement provided by her mother she was described as 'shy' and and 'uncomfortable' with new people. Despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage, Miah claimed that he did not target her, adding: 'She looks 20.' Support: Miah is a fan of Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary (above) 'He didn’t seek her out, he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend, not because she looks young, she looks 20,' said hi barrister Edward Jones said. 'This was a young man confused about religious beliefs, smoking cannabis to significant degree. He has now sought to reform himself. 'He made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated.' Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said while the defendant had planned 'some sort of sexual activity', he was not a 'predatory paedophile'. 'You have not repeated this offence, so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type I’m afraid we often see in this court, and the fact you didn't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened. 'A suspended sentence is appropriate. 'A prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did, and a course of treatment to ensure it doesn't happen again and to protect young girls.' The judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if Miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe. 'The victim was just 15 and was young for her age, her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise. 'You had no sexual experience. You were feeling depressed and isolated, you were smoking cannabis. 'I accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls.' He also praised him for being 'helpful' to the police, who described him as a 'different person' from the one who had committed the offences. Miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. .","Mansoor Miah contacted the girl over social media as she played Nintendo .

The post also counseled that, despite 2015 marking two years since San Francisco's controversial nudity ban, no one has been cited during a naked ride. That appeared to have remained the case with Saturday's ride. However, the same wasn't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the Castro District was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law, which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits.

Officers said the trio had to be taken into custody instead of being cited because they did not have identification.

3a80ed1ae9e57130e636330a9c55227a325eba47,"Nicola Tweedy, 54, died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital . The death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented, her husband has today claimed. Nicola Tweedy, 54, had the operation at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in March last year and was discharged the same evening. But two days later the mother-of-two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in Pulham Market, Norfolk. When her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant, they called an ambulance. Despite the best efforts of the paramedics called, Mrs Tweedy died. A post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot which reached her lungs. An inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure Mrs Tweedy was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation, because of an 'oversight'. Her husband, Chris Tweedy, 53, said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital, claiming he believes his wife's death could have been prevented. The postman, who lives with the couple's two children, said: 'They were required to avoid harming her and, tragically, in my opinion, they did not.' South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said the case was a 'tragedy' which should prompt improvements. He added: 'It is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for Mrs Tweedy, most crucially to place Mrs Tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation. 'Any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly. People are only human. 'But in the post-Mid Staffs world, when things have been less than perfect, patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness.' Consultant vascular surgeon Robert Brightwell admitted to the inquest in Norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed. That meant the 54-year-old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery, including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index. Nurse Susan Brown said she accepted it was 'an oversight' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient's discharge notes. Coroner Jacqueline Lake gave a narrative conclusion that Mrs Tweedy died following a 'rare but recognised' risk of surgery, adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented. She said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately. But raised concerns that Mrs Tweedy had not been given the correct leaflets on her care. Speaking after the inquest Mr Tweedy said his family's lives had been 'damaged beyond repair'. He described his wife and his 'happy, smiling soul-mate'. Mrs Tweedy's husband, Chris, 53, who lives with the couple's two children, said he believes his wife's death could have been prevented . A post mortem examination revealed Mrs Tweedy died of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs . He added: 'Nicky was a happy, smiling, laughing, easy going, fun loving person all of her life. 'She was someone who loved, cared for, guided, supported and helped so many people throughout her life. 'In my opinion, the Norfolk and Norwich  would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife's death, and to materially revise their protocols and procedures, which they have subsequently done, without my formal complaint and, even after that, without the very considerable pressure I have placed upon them, both personally and through other organisations. 'In the United Kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism. 'Many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences. 'That, in my opinion, is a national scandal.' A hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the Tweedy family. She added: 'Mrs Tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery, estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases, in other words one in 10,000 patients. 'While it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely. 'The trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services. 'Once we have the coroner's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement.' Lawyer Sharon Allison, of Ashton KCJ which represented the family, said: 'My client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss. 'They have many questions relating to the hospital's protocols concerning blood clotting risks.' An inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed, meaning Mrs Tweedy was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation .","Nicola Tweedy had an operation on her varicose veins last March .

The indications are that Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow, but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows. The fact England turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty-boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst-ever World Cup. Victory against Afghanistan would perhaps give Moores breathing space before the squad is announced on Tuesday for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moores attempts to rally his troops on the SCG on Wednesday ahead of their match against Afghanistan . Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by Bangladesh while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his left foot. It is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup: James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, who could then be making their final ODI appearances. After the World Cup England must start from scratch with a one-day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in persevering in 50-over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson, who said on Wednesday he wants to play on. His is not a view shared by former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Young England quick Chris Jordan works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the Sydney sunshine . In his Evening Standard column Prior wrote: ‘Men like Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad... remain key members of the Test side, so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game, especially with an Ashes summer approaching.’ There is a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team in coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman. He would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said: ‘We still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order. If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock.’","Former England opener Mark Butcher told fans not to watch the Ashes .

Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work. However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service. Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left), who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women, has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed Claudia Aderotimi (right) Former madam: Windslowe, a former 'Black Madam' (pictured) had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service . Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart. During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon. The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.' Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant. The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life. Aspiring hip-hop artists: Today, the defendant (pictured left and right) was convicted of third-degree murder after Miss Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and college student, died from a silicone injection in her buttocks . Tragic death: Miss Aderotimi (pictured), who was injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died a few hours later . In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections. And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone. Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.' Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client. The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites. Claims: Windslowe's colorful testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose (pictured) was 'a walking billboard' for her untrained work . There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections. A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case. Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children. When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week. 'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 'But there was no exam.' Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers. 'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'","Padge-Victoria Windslowe convicted of third-degree murder by jury today .

811d53b2ea2852190f5b1da3f163dcc18e24a746,"(CNN)""There's a baby. There's a baby."" The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. The 18-month-old girl hangs upside down after her mother's car crashed and flipped into a frigid Utah river some 14 hours earlier. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life. The car landed on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. From the murky waters, the rescuer hands baby Lily to a police officer. He dashes up the rocky banks of the Spanish Fork, pressing the infant close to his chest for warmth. ""Got it,"" the officer is heard saying. Lily is freezing. ""Come on, baby,"" he says. ""She's definitely hypothermic."" In the ambulance, the officer pats little Lily on the back in an attempt to get her breathing. Lily is on her side. She looks pale, her tiny arm appears stiff. ""Come on, sweetie,"" the officer implores. ""Come on, sweetie."" On the ambulance to a hospital, rescuers perform CPR. They try to warm her. ""We're almost there,"" one rescuer is heard to say. ""Are you getting a pulse?"" ""I can't feel anything,"" says another. At the hospital, as Lily is rushed into the emergency room, she vomits. ""We've been doing CPR on her,"" the officer tells emergency room personnel. ""She's been throwing up a little bit."" Those moments captured by the body cam video -- which first aired on CNN affiliate KSL -- were crucial. ""If anything had been different, she might not have made it,"" emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. In the ER, Lily opened her eyes as CPR was performed to get her heart pumping, Royall said. Another important factor was a car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age, and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside-down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but even more dangerous if the baby had gotten wet. ""She seems to be doing great,"" said Officer Jason Howard of the Spanish Fork Police Department. ""We were able to get together with her and her family. She was happy and smiling. Seemed to be a normal and happy, healthy baby."" Howard said the toddler temporarily was staying with an aunt and uncle. Her father, Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. ""(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home."" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. ""She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,"" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: ""I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that."" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. ""I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,"" said Trafny.

504b5538a98febc571f24cf6cbeec730e380511b,"The damning thing for Leicester in this match they really needed to win was that there was no cavalry charge, no guns blazing crescendo. Tom Huddlestone was dismissed for second bookable offence with 18 minutes to go but Allan McGregor in the Hull goal had not one meaningful save to make as the clock ticked down. In fact, it was Mark Schwarzer who had to be alert. In the final minute he reacted expertly to stop an Abel Hernandez shot following a quickly-taken free-kick by Dame N’Doye. Had that gone in, the obituaries on Leicester’s Premier League life could have been signed off.

Leicester are seven points from safety, even if Sunderland are dropping like a stone having played a game more. Leicester’s match in hand is against Chelsea. Martin O’Neill was at the King Power Stadium as a guest of the club he served so well in two League Cup triumphs. This season is heading for a more sombre conclusion to those heady days. Nigel Pearson is realistic, knowing uncommon improvement is needed immediately. ‘We’ve got ten games left, six at home, we probably need to win five,’ he said having seen his side win only four times all campaign. ‘When the pressure was on us to go and create I don’t think we did. We were laboured.’ Steve Bruce was disappointed at a different aspect, the clamour for a card from Leicester players when Alex Bruce tackled Riyad Mahrez in the second half. The ball was won but referee Jon Moss produced a yellow, soon after erring similarly in booking Craig Dawson. Leicester City keeper Mark Schwarzer punches clear as Dame N'Doye of Hull and Ritchie De Laet of the Foxes vie for the ball . ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make,’ said Bruce. ‘If we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ When a game begins with six centre-halves on the pitch there is a reasonable assumption goals will be in short supply. Jake Livermore of Hull attempts to keep possession at the King Power Stadium under pressure from Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso . Leicester matched Hull in a 3-5-2 formation, with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger. They did their jobs well, in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome. It took Leicester until 62 minutes to register a shot on target, and even that was a mishit cross by Jamie Vardy, requiring a palm over from McGregor. Hull were only marginally better, but should have gone ahead in the 20th minute only for Nikica Jelavic to get himself in a terrible tangle. In a contender for miss of the season, he failed to put boot to ball from six yards with the net open. Huddlestone chipped the ball over the backline of blue shirts to find Ahmed Elmohamady sprinting clear, having timed his run perfectly to stay onside. The Egyptian squared the ball to take out Schwarzer but Jelavic failed badly. Six minutes later he did have the ball in the back of the net. But Moss had already blown for a foul on Schwarzer by N’Doye. Leicester’s best opening of the first-half came in the 34th minute when Mahrez delivered a wicked cross that bent into the area in front of Andrej Kramaric. But the £9million striker was either caught on his heels or disinclined to make the leap required to meet the ball and it drifted wide. Tom Huddlestone puts in a robust challenge on Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric during the Premier League clash on Saturday . Referee Jonathan Moss hands out the yellow card to Hull City defender Alex Bruce (left) as tempers threatened to boil over . This was a bad game for Kramaric, unable to affect it in any way and he was hooked for Leonardo Ulloa after an hour. Soon after Jelavic headed over from a corner by Gaston Ramirez. That is when Leicester began to make a more concerted effort to win three points rather than one. Vardy was a nuisance all match for the Hull defenders, his pace and energy unsettling. It was he who stretched his legs down the left before cutting in and forcing Huddlestone into a foul he wished not to make. He tried to back out of it but the contact sent Vardy to the floor. Abel Hernandez of Hull City has his head in his hands after a missed chance to fire the Tigers into the lead at the King Power Stadium . Moss, soon after dishing out two wholy incorrect bookings for ‘fouls’ by Dawson and Bruce, got this yellow right. From the free-kick Jeff Schlupp struck a shot that was heading in until Ulloa inadvertently blocked. With the man advantage Leicester pressed but without cultivating anything to truly worry Bruce. The crowd willed the ball in for the final few minutes but boos greeted the final whistle. This felt like a fatal opportunity missed.","Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone sent off in the second-half for two bookable offences .

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo González, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, said: 'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .","Russian photographer Nick Larionstev captured a video of mould growing .

Myers' body was found in Cactus Park, Mesa County on February 28. The teenager had been missing since December 18. Kelly Mae Myers, 18, died of a 'mixed drug intoxication', according to the Mesa County Coroner's office. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase at a Colorado park on February 28 . Police say Eduardo De La Cruz, 30 (left) was staying at the same hotel where Myers died. Raymond Cordova, 47 (right), an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house and allegedly dumped her body . Colorado police ruled her death as 'suspicious' but have not yet officially declared it a homicide. Officials said they would not release any more information regarding Myters' cause of death at this time because of the ongoing investigation, according to Fox 13 Now. Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News revealed. Police are currently investigating two persons of interest, Eduardo De La Cruz and Raymond Cordova,  in connection with Myers' disappearance. De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin but is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police said. Myers' body was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died at a West Valley City hotel . He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation. Myers was last seen in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City for a party. Relatives who reported her missing in Colorado said the teenager's disappearance was 'out of character'. Myers' mother Kim Lee told Fox 13 Now she had never heard of De La Cruz or Cordova before they were arrested. 'This wasn't just a piece of trash that you stuffed, and I hate saying that word, but you put in a suitcase,' she said. 'This was a human being, this was my daughter.' Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, a police affidavit stated. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel in West Valley City. De La Cruz had checked into the hotel the day Myers is believed to have died, police say. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel . An informant told police Myers' body was placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell' and that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase, according to The Deseret News. He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time.

Lamis Khamis, 42, was behind the wheel of her black 2.0 litre Audi when she got into a row with a man riding an electric-powered bicycle at a roundabout near Shepherd's Bush Green, in London. After the man kicked her car, Khamis followed him and drove her car into him at low speed, knocking him off his bike. Fashion designer to the stars Lamis Khamis has been fined £600 after she followed a cyclist in her car and deliberately knocked him over after the pair had argued and he kicked her Audi on a London roundabout . Khamis was fined £600 after a judge ruled that on her part 'it should not be described as road rage', but added that the cyclist could have been injured. The designer launched her own brand in 2001 after she graduated from Camberwell College of Arts. She set up a stall to sell her wares in Portobello Market in London and has since then attracted the attention of model Cara Delevingne, who has been pictured wearing her designs, Paris Hilton and musician Chris Brown. At a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and a valid MOT on May 17. The fashion designer, who graduated from the Camberwell College of Arts, has worked with celebrities including Rita Ora (pictured) Model Cara Delevingne is pictured wearing a Lamis Khamis creation (left), while Katie Price worked with the designer in 2011 on fashion line Day 22, which she promoted on the Pure Spirit catwalk (right) The court heard that after the cyclist kicked the side of her car as they argued at the roundabout he made a dent, costing around £300 to repair. Recorder John Gallagher said: 'He rode off, but because his cycle had no registration plate you followed in an attempt to obtain details from him. 'You, in an attempt to stop him, drove into him and he fell off his cycle. Your actions were deliberate, but it was not a case of running a person down because you were only travelling at 10mph and he sustained no injuries. Lamis Khamis is pictured with Paris Hilton (centre), who is a fan of her designs and Sam Pemberton (left) 'However, this was a deliberate act and he might well have been injured and you did not consider the risks and alternatives.' Mr Gallagher also gave Khamis six penalty points on her licence. But he added: 'You are a mature lady who has never been in trouble with the police in the past and you have a clean driving licence and in twenty years have had no disqualifications.' The court heard that the prosecution had previously dropped a more serious charge of dangerous driving. Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and was fined, after the judge ruled the incident was not one of road rage, but that the victim could have been injured in the incident .","Lamis Khamis was driving in Shepherd's Bush when she got into an argument with a man on an electric bicycle who kicked her black Audi .

He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.

'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard. He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof. The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am. CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten. Ben Cousins, in 2007, after he was charged with drug possession and refusing a drug test . Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy . On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News. He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'. The 36-year-old was moved out of the hospital on the afternoon of March 16 but doctors remain concerned about his mental health, Seven News reports. Cousins was arrested the week prior for allegedly driving erratically and not stopping when requested by police. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8. Cousins retired from the sport in 2010. He appeared in court in 2012 after being charged with drug possession . Cousins, 36, was arrested last week after allegedly being caught driving recklessly and failing to give a breath test. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8 . The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus. He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.

c66e49d676589e081b4f8af825875474f707e0e1,"A Silicon Valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three-year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination. Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao, 45, sued her former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for four counts of discrimination after she was fired. In a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry, Pao painted the firm as sexist, crude, and quarrelsome. On Friday, a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in San Francisco Superior Court. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ellen Pao (pictured after the verdict) sued her former employers for four counts of gender bias after she was fired. The Reddit CEO claimed her career crumbled at Kleiner after ending an affair with a partner . A jury of six men and six women rejected all of Pao's claims in San Francisco Superior Court on Friday . Over the course of three years, Pao told the court her career at the Silicon Valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner Ajit Nazre, and was fired in 2012 when she complained. Pao, who is married to Wall Street financier Alphonse Fletcher Jr, said he 'falsely told her that his wife had left him' and 'engaged in offensive, obstructionist, and difficult behavior' until she 'succumbed' two or three times. After she ended the liaison, he started to 'retaliate', she claimed. At one point, she said, Nazre appeared at her colleague's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe, carrying a glass of wine, according to testimony. The court heard Ray Lane, a former partner, said the woman, Trae Vassallo, should have been 'flattered'. Kleiner countered that it investigated Nazre after Vassallo complained, after which he quickly left the firm. Pao's first claim, tabled in 2007, also accused senior partner Randy Komisar of giving her a Leonard Cohen book, Book Of Longing, filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems. Later, he asked her to dinner adding that 'his wife would be out of town'. The case played out as Silicon Valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists. Recent figures collected by Babson College show six per cent of the venture capital is female, down from 10 per cent in 1999. With that backdrop, Pao's lawyers described Kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women. One of Pao's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted, rather than gender . The firm disputed those charges, presenting evidence that Kleiner went out of its way to hire women. During the case, the court heard one partner, Chi-Hua Chien, said women 'kill the buzz' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with Al Gore. John Doerr, once Pao's direct boss, told investigators she had 'a female chip on her shoulder'. And senior partner Ted Schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg that women 'deserve a seat at the table'. He said: 'I really don’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not.' Specifically, Pao alleged that: . The jury ruled against Pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount. Two hours later, they emerged in favor of Kleiner Perkins. The court requires a minimum of 9-3 votes to come to a conclusion. But initially, the verdict stated that four jurors supported Pao's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination. On the pivotal claim that Pao was fired for being female, ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor. They came to their conclusion after completing this question-and-answer document. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Elder, Pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost. Some witnesses, including Pao's onetime mentor John Doerr, testified that Pao's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance, not discrimination or retaliation. However, Pao's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in RPX and Twitter. Pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was 'professional to enter into an affair with a married partner?' 'Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time,' Pao said. Following the verdict on Friday, Pao released a statement via Twitter. In nine tweets, she wrote: 'Thank you, world. 'I have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support. 'I’ve heard from people in Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, France, Argentina, Norway, Tanzania, Finland, and beyond. 'Because of social media and live reports, the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe . 'While today’s outcome is a disappointment, I take consolation in knowing that people really listened . 'If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change . 'Hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone, including women and minorities . 'To support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, we need to show leadership today.

""He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home,"" Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. ""He said tell everybody he is doing well."" Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan.

e2c0cb3ed7d83a68b46de8c843dd6306a0e030cd,"It would be lovely to think that Nick Cruwys will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters. At the time of writing he is in a coma, fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of Wolverhampton Wanderers fans as he made his way to the railway station after Watford's 2-2 draw at Molineux on Saturday. A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches. Watford fan Nick Cruwys (left) is currently in a coma after being ambushed by a group of Wolves fans as he made his way to the station following the 2-2 draw in the Championship fixture (right) at Molineux on Saturday . Over £22,000 has been raised for Nick Cruwys via a football fund set up by group of  Wolves supporters . Watford fan Nick Cruwys lies on the ground as he is attacked following his side's draw with Wolves . Cruwys is currently in an induced coma and fighting for his life in hospital . Cruwys was heading to Wolverhampton train station when he was subjected to an 'unprovoked attack' The initial target was £1,000 but by Tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £22,089. Football can respond in the most remarkable ways, but these supporters know that society's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place. We have a tendency to move on so quickly, to switch on the television set, to sit down to watch Liverpool against Blackburn and then look forward to a mouth-watering FA Cup tie between Manchester United and Arsenal. It is natural. Always looking forward, leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on Saturday. Nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. But sometimes we must pause for thought, to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. To wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband, their dad, their son, is lying in a hospital, in a coma, may never wake up. Cruwys was making his way to the train station after the 2-2 draw between the sides at Molineux (pictured) Troy Deeney (left) stretches out top convert the equaliser  for Watford who took a point in a 2-2 draw . Deeney celebrates after his goal prevented rivals Wolves from taking all three points in the promotion race . Or to consider his friends, the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station. Or the innocent bystanders, the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place. They, too, will be traumatised. Then there are the perpetrators, the thugs who are responsible for this attack. Are they proud men today, or hiding like cowards? Cruwys is a football fan like me or you, following his team - Watford, in this case - around the country on a Saturday afternoon. There is a rising tide in the sport, the 'Who-Wants-Some?' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from Villa Park last weekend. What is the motivation for this? Please don't say a 5.30pm kick-off meaning lads full of ale, because that is no excuse either. We cannot put a news value on someone's existence either, just because the team Cruwys follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the Barclays Premier League each weekend. This is someone's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues. Aston Villa fans storm on to the Villa Park pitch after their 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup . The 5.30pm kick-off in the West Midlands derby on Saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans . West Midlands Police are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days. There is a desire to do more, to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people, however small their number, throwing punches, even in isolated incidents. For Cruwys and his friends, who were among the 2,239 Watford supporters who made the trip to Wolves, the game was a real nail-biter. Leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point. The Watford great Kenny Jackett, a long-serving player and former manager at Vicarage Road, is now manager of Wolves. He remains a popular figure with their fans. Towards the end of a riveting 2-2 draw, Wolves defender Bakary Sako was sent off when Watford substitute Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face. That incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett is a former Watford player and manager and remains a popular figure with fans . Bakary Sako was sent off after Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face following an altercation . To think Cruwys's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory. This is the unacceptable face of the game, a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums. According to Home Office statistics there were only 2,273 football-related arrests last year, which includes all four divisions, plus European competitions and internationals. It is the lowest since records began. Last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested. The numbers look good on paper, but the Home Office also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests. If 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at Villa Park - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned . Fans charge towards Scott Sinclair and his team-mates after his goal against West Brom on Saturday . For example, let's say around 5,000 Villa supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2-0 victory over West Brom in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Theoretically, every one of them could be arrested and banned from Villa Park for life. It will never happen, which is why those Home Office statistics can easily be distorted. There is certainly some grim reading in the West Midlands at the moment, with the police force making further appeals on Monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in Wolverhampton. Wrong place, wrong time? Don't give me that.

'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Ron Hunter said after the game in a Vine video. The White House wouldn't apologize on Friday for Obama's incorrect assumption that the Baylor Bears, a 3-seed in the tournament, would prevail against the Georgia State Panthers. The president's spokesman did say, however that the young man who scored the winning basket 'certainly rose to the occasion.' Scroll down for video . RJ Hunter (left, with basketball) made a last-minute three-pointer to send his Georgia State Panthers to the next round of the NCAA Tournament . RJ's father Ron (center) , Georgia State's coach, fell off of his rolling chair, which he was forced to sit on after tearing his Achilles tendon on Sunday . The elder hunter was helped up from the floor by assistants after the stunning shot sank in, leading the 14-seed to upset 3-seed Baylor . Coach Hunter drew nationwide attention after he toppled off of the stool from which he had been cheering on his team after son RJ hit a deep three-pointer, putting the Panthers up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining. Baylor had been favorited in the game by 9. With the younger Hunter on fire, scoring 16 points, Georgia State claimed victory in the final seconds of the game. The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. Remarking on the surprising come-from-behind win on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ''That was a great shot there at the end of the game.' 'I think there’s no question that...that kind of high- level performance when the chips are down is certainly the kind of...spirit that the president would hope to summon in the context of his job, too,' he added. Georgia State, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001, was picked by few to advance to the second round. President Barack Obama had Baylor winning the game in his bracket. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Hunter said after the game, teassing the president . Coach Hunter's assistants had to help him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics. He had been perched on the rolling chair to reduce the strain of a Achilles tendon injury he incurred while celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern. The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game. Georgia State will play No. 6 team Xavier in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West division of this year's bracket. Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, favored by 14 points.

980e9f43ec7c6c31ab340bec30f63852e523d889,"An exodus of GPs leaving to work abroad or take early retirement means surgeries across England are in crisis, experts warned last night. The number of family doctors applying to work in Australia, Canada and other countries where they can earn more for fewer hours has jumped by 40 per cent in just five years. And around 22,400 GPs – more than half of England’s 40,200 family doctors – want to retire before the usual age of 60, separate figures show. Lured away: Online ads promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’ if they leave Britain for Australia (file image) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make ‘important changes’ to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs. Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered. It follows the Mail’s revelation last week how one practice, in Swinton, South Yorkshire, was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment. Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP at the Crown Street Surgery, told Inside Out that three of its doctors had moved to Australia and Canada since last summer due to ‘unsustainable daily pressure’. The programme, being broadcast tonight, also obtained figures from the General Medical Council that revealed 792 GPs were given ‘Certificates of Good Standing’ last year to allow them to practise abroad. This compares to 576 in 2008 and 562 in 2009. Crisis: Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered (file photo) The NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a ‘fully funded induction and returner scheme’. On top of the exodus to foreign climes, 56 per cent of GPs ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ expect to leave the profession before their 60th birthday, according to a survey of 1,004 family doctors carried out by Inside Out. Dr David Jones, 46, who formerly practised in Manchester, moved to Perth, Western Australia, over a year ago. He said: ‘We arrived in November 2013. It’s wonderful here. We do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine. I’m very, very proud of what my colleagues at home do. They do an incredibly difficult job. They get assaulted from all sides. ‘I do feel guilty to some extent. When a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country. But the way that asset is being treated in that country, it’s just pushing people away. It’s reached a point where people are just saying no, I’m not doing this any more. ‘We shouldn’t be here. Had our profession been looked after as it should have been we wouldn’t think about leaving.’ The website GP Jobs in Australia promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’. It adds: ‘Typical earnings start from £145,000 and rise to £195,000 per annum after a few years’ experience.’ But it says doctors working in rural locations can earn ‘considerably more’, adding: ‘Compared to the NHS, there’s less hassle, less bureaucracy, more medicine and money.’ Younger doctors are not plugging the gaps, with up to one in eight GP training posts unfilled. They are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons. The situation has become so dire that 1,063 GPs are needed just to return to the patient-to-doctor ratio of 2009, according to separate figures released by the House of Commons Library. Under the previous Labour government, GPs benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to £105,000 a year and enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work. But many doctors now say they are dismayed by the volume of paperwork, the demands of the ageing population and the insufficient funds given to surgeries by the Government. Mr Hunt said yesterday: ‘What I hope GPs recognise is the things they’ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed. 'They said they didn’t like the targets they have, what are called the QOF targets, and we’ve reduced those by 40 per cent. ‘They said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the Autumn Statement. ‘These things don’t happen overnight so I would urge people to bear with us while we make these really important changes. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS – but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis. It is getting harder and harder to get a GP appointment as a result.’","Online ads promises British GPs more money for less hours in Australia .

Ken Gregory, 65, suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body after the assault at his £295,000 bungalow in Peterborough in March last year. A year on, pictures of his injuries show painful blistering stretching from his scalp to his lower back - and some of the scars will never fade. Scroll down for video . Ken Gregory was left horrifically scarred after his now ex-wife threw boiling water over him   in March last year . Mr Gregory met Teresa Gilbertson (pictured together) through ballroom dancing, but they relationship became sour after five years of marriage . His ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Mr Gregory has decided to speak out because he believes it is important to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Retired BT manager Mr Gregory said: 'Being attacked by a woman is nothing to be ashamed of.' 'I had never imagined something like this would happen to me. 'As a man who is a bit older and who isn't exactly small, there is a perception that you can't be a victim of domestic violence. 'I was worried that people would assume that it was my fault and she was the victim - there is still a general perception that, as a strong man against a weaker female, you must have been the protagonist. A year on, the retired BT manager is speaking out to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Pictured, Mr Gregory with the jug his ex-wife used . Mr Gregory's ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Pictured, injuries to his back (left) and shoulder (right) 'But it should be the same message that they put out for women many years ago: don't be frightened, you don't have to put up with it.' The couple met through ballroom dancing following the death of Mr Gregory's first wife   of more than 30 years, Maureen, seven years ago. But after five years of marriage, their relationship soured. On the day of the attack on March 23, Mr Gregory had been due to take flowers to his late wife's memorial to mark her birthday.  Instead the couple rowed over finances and household chores. Eventually, they reached an apparently mutual  decision to get a divorce and Gilbertson had offered to make a cup of tea. Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, turned down the offer, but his wife left the room and returned with a jug of freshly boiled water. Peterborough Crown Court heard she told him 'there you go' after tipping it over his head without warning. It was the culmination of escalating verbal abuse. Three weeks earlier, Mr Gregory needed hospital treatment after Gilbertson threw a cup of tea over him while he slept, in what she claimed was an accident. When police arrived following the final incident, Mr Gregory said she told officers: 'If I'd wanted to kill him, I'd have used a knife.' Reliving the incident, Mr Gregory said: 'I was sitting with my back to her and it came without warning. 'It was unbearable, searing pain - I'd never known anything like it. 'Afterwards I could barely sleep as I couldn't lie on my back.' Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, said the injuries meant he barely sleep after the attack . Experts told the trial that the pattern of the injuries showed the water must have been poured deliberately - and not by accident. Mr Gregory said: 'From the start, the police took it very seriously and even our mutual friends were able to see that I was the innocent party. 'If other men find themselves in this position, I would say don't be embarrassed or ashamed - my case goes to show that this can happen to anybody.' Detective Inspector Mark Woolner, from Cambridgeshire Police's domestic abuse unit, said the force has specially-trained officers who support both male and female victims of domestic violence. He said:  'Men affected by domestic abuse often feel that they won't be taken seriously, but this simply isn't the case.' Gilbertson will be sentenced on March 24 after being found guilty earlier this month.","Ken Gregory suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body .

Paul Bell, a director of 666Bet, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow airport last week as part of a joint money-laundering investigation by HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency. Six other people were arrested, 13 properties were raided and £1m in cash was also seized as part of the investigation.

It also signed former QPR manager Redknapp to appear in its adverts, alongside Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vas Blackwood. Last week, the UK gambling regulator The Gambling Commission suspended the firm's licence. The suspension led to Football League One side Leyton Orient, which signed a contract with the bookmakers in August last year, terminating its deal for shirt sponsorship.

Arsenal and United have had plenty of heated battles with Wenger referencing the infamous 'Battle of Old Trafford' incident as the one that stands out. Speaking to Sportsmail columnist Keown on BBC Radio 5 Live, Wenger recalled the defender's confrontation with Van Nistelrooy following the United striker's  penalty miss in September 2003. Martin Keown confronts Ruud van Nistelrooy following the United striker's missed penalty in September 2003 . Keown screams at Van Nistelrooy following his last-minute spot kick miss during the 'Battle of Old Trafford' Arsene Wenger told Keown that the incident was his most memorable from Arsenal's encounters with  United . 'The most memorable? You were involved in it,' Wenger said jokingly to Keown. 'Of course that famous incident with the penalty with Van Nistelrooy.' As Arsenal gear up for their FA Cup sixth round tie against Manchester United next Monday, Wenger insists he is as hungry as ever for success. Arsenal and United have enjoyed an intense rivalry in the cup down the years and are only separated by a point in the Barclays Premier League. Ahead of Monday's clash, Wenger admitted he didn't know where his FA Cup medals from previous successes were. 'Medals, I don't even know where there are,' said Wenger. 'That tells you that I don't look back. The human side of the game is more important to me as opposed to the medals. 'I prefer a box of memories. In this job, you have a big influence in people's lives, they have a big influence in your life as well. 'At the top top level, these are special people - that remains longer with you than the medal, it's not the only thing that matters. 'You want to think you can have a positive influence on people lives, the club and the style of play.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger oversees training at the club's base in Colney on Monday . Wenger will attempt to outwit United manager Louis van Gaal, who has been criticised recently, but the Frenchman reserved special praise for the Dutchman. 'I think he's a great manager,' said Wenger. 'If you look at what he's done in his career, its incredible. He's stabilised the club. They've only lost two in 18 games. The job is more demanding now. Every game now is a trial where you judged before and after.' Arsenal's intense rivalry with United was defined for years by Wenger's clashes with Sir Alex Ferguson. 'I'm much happier to see him now than before,' Wenger added. 'In the end, it became more peaceful and respectful. He was not always objective defending his time, nor was I. 'Today, we are happy to have a good dinner or good glass of wine and just talk about football.'

The 51-year-old former European middleweight champion has started chemotherapy, walking to a hospital near his south London home for each session to keep fit. The determined former boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer. Boxing champion Errol Christie (left) has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life . He told the Sunday People: 'I am just starting my treatment. I've had my first round of chemo and it has really been tough but I am going to beat this.' Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk – it seems so unfair. 'Being who he is, he didn’t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up. 'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is ­remaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I’m very proud of how he is coping.' Christie, pictured during his memorable bout with Mark Kaylor (right) in 1985, has started chemotherapy . Explosive: Christie (right) and Kaylor got up close and personal while promoting their clash in 1985 . Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness. Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis. During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout. He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored. Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993. Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt. The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown. Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'","Errol Christie has revealed that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer .

Embarrassed waiters apologised and handed over the £7.25 but when pest control examined the creature they found it had the appearance of a domestic pet, and had recently 'had a haircut'. This is the moment diner Christopher Baker, 28, (pictured left) tried to get out of paying for his £7.25 Valentine's Day buffet meal for one by releasing his pet rat into the restaurant . Baker (left) admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, but angry owner Kevin Smith (right) says Baker has caused him 'nothing but grief' Baker ordered the meal from the Borneo Bistro in Sunderland (pictured) and sat down to eat alone, before pulling the pet rodent from his pocket, releasing it onto the floor and demanding a refund . The pet rat released into the restaurant. Pest controllers said it appeared to be tame, and had recently had its fur trimmed . Bistro owner Kevin Smith then checked the restaurant's CCTV and spotted Baker producing the rat and putting it on the floor. Baker, of Houghton, Sunderland later admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, as well as a £60 victim surcharge. 'On February 14 - Valentine's Day - Mr Baker has attended the restaurant, ordered a buffet for one and a bottle of water,' Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told Sunderland Magistrates' Court. 'He picked his food up and found a seat at a table on his own at the back of the restaurant. 'At shortly before 4pm he suddenly jumps up and shouts 'It's a rat. I'm not eating here, I want my money back'. 'Mr Smith perhaps smelled a rat at this particular point and he retrieved the rat from the floor.

The footage shows Baker get money out of his pocket - then appear to change his mind and get the rat out . Baker retrieved the rat from his pocket as a family sitting nearby moved away from their table . 'He waited until a family moved from the table next to him and retrieved what appeared to be a rat from his pocket and dropped it on the floor. He then jumped out of his seat. 'He then claimed that whilst he's been eating, the rat has bitten his finger. He asked for his money back. 'It was a black and white rat, very calm. It did not appear to be wild at all. Acorn Pest Control attended and they said it appeared to be a pet. 'Mr Smith viewed the CCTV and saw the defendant fiddling in his pocket.' Baker then puts the rat on the floor and leaps out of his chair to the astonishment of fellow diners . The court was told that Baker had claimed that as he ate, the rat bit him on the finger . Baker was seen jumping up and shouting: 'It's a rat.

He then puts it on the floor and leaps out of his chair and backs away to the astonishment of fellow diners. They then see the rat and jump up themselves and most head towards the door of the bistro looking horrified. Within minutes every customer is on their feet while staff try and catch Baker's pet. Baker was later arrested and told police that he had bought the rat from a pet shop as a gift for his daughter, before placing it in his pocket and heading to the restaurant. Willie Johnstone, defending, said: 'We do deal with some unusual cases from time to time. 'Christopher, on that day, had been drinking heavily and unfortunately he decided to buy a rat for his daughter by way of a present. A fellow customer points out the rat to a member of restaurant staff inside the bistro . 'Unfortunately, he then decided to go for a meal. He sat down and ate his meal. When he had finished the meal, he took the rat out. He is very remorseful for his behaviour.' In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Smith said the potential damage to his business's reputation could have been 'catastrophic', and that Baker could have ruined the future of the restaurant that he had spent seven years building up. As well as being ordered to pay the victim surcharge and compensation, Baker was sentenced to a 12-month community order with supervision. He was also banned from going to the restaurant for a year. Chairman of the bench, Derek Moss, said: 'This is a very serious matter as what you have done here could in a split-second have ruined this man's business, which he has worked for years to build up a reputation for.' Speaking after the case, Mr Smith branded Baker 'scum', and said he deserved to be punished. The 47-year-old said: 'He is just the scum of the earth. He could have destroyed the reputation I have built up over seven years. 'I was devastated. I thought 'that's it my business is gone'. I didn't sleep that night. 'People like him deserve the death penalty.' 'As far as I'm concerned, he shouldn't be in our society. He is no use to anybody and he's caused nothing but grief.

This stunning weather map shows how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest February's on record, while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average . The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover.

The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California'sthree-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years . Researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the US last. NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a persistent ridge of high pressure—nicknamed the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”—over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'","Weather map produced using data from NASA's Terra Satellite that measures land surface temperature .

She paired her Preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free. Her swept back pompadour-inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance. The overall effect was decidedly grown up and dressy, but with a laid back insouciant vibe.

17e14ffdecaa9bf007bf7cb130b503c36a49347b,"Nigel Pearson has been caught on camera appearing to swear at a journalist after taking issue with a line of questioning. The Leicester City manager was picked up on microphone seeming to call the reporter a ‘p****’ under his breath as his press conference following the 0-0 draw with Hull City ended. Pearson was annoyed about a question over Steve Bruce’s claim Leicester’s players crowded referee Jon Moss in an attempt to get Alex Bruce sent off for a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Nigel Pearson's outburst . Nigel Pearson fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with Hull . After concluding the press conference, Pearson muttered 'waxing away, my a***' under his breath . He was then further angered by the suggestion his team’s season was ‘waxing or waning’ with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety. ‘Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,’ Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: ‘P****.’ Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters. Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I’m naive. 'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don’t start doing it. 'There’s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I’d never cheat to win.' He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite. The Leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a 'p****' for the line of questioning . Pearson looks frustrated during another game where his Leicester side failed to win . It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined £10,000 for telling a supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after receiving sustained abuse. In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play. The next day brought Pearson’s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. Bruce’s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. ‘For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. ‘No,’ he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off… . Did they? Oh very nice. Do you think that’s a fair criticism? No. What’s your take on that situation? I’ve just said no. But what’s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee? How many times have you seen us play this year? Three times. Well there you are then. You’re not in a position to judge my players on that. I’m not judging anyone. I’m just asking you… . You’ve asked me and I’ve told you. No was the answer. I don’t think it’s a fair assessment. Full stop. Do you consider that Leicester’s season is waxing or waning? I don’t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We’ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That’s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Yep good thank you. Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***. P****. Pearson seems to be feeling the pressure as his side remain rooted to the bottom of the table .

FA technical director Dan Ashworth and England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate want young England players to gain tournament experience. Their view has the backing of chairman Greg Dyke, leading to the FA changing their mind about sending only a women’s side — if any — to Brazil. The FA’s departing general secretary Alex Horne wrote to the other three countries on his last day in office at Wembley informing them that it was now their intention to enter both Olympic football competitions.

FA technical director Dan Ashworth, pictured talking to Roy Hodgson, shares the views of the Under 21 boss . Former Manchester united midfielder Ryan Giggs captained Team GB at the 2012 Olympics . However, the manner of the FA taking the lead on raising the teams infuriated Wales, especially, and Northern Ireland, leading to a stormy meeting between officials at the IFAB summit in Belfast last Friday. Scotland were less concerned because of their long, unequivocal opposition to the GB football format, which they see as a threat to their independence within FIFA. The main sensitivity with the Welsh and the Irish was why the FA had the divine right to be the national association with the football seat on the British Olympic Association since its inception in 1905. Wales are also upset about the FA reneging — owing to a rules change — on a gentlemen’s agreement over the rotation of the British vice-president seat on FIFA executive committee.

The rumpus has led to FIFA telling the FA to sort out the internal fighting before submitting their GB football applications. The men’s side would need to reach the last four of the European Under 21 Championship this summer to qualify. The Olympic issue has raised extra emotions because it follows all the fuss around the home nations providing players at London 2012 for a Team GB side that the BOA mandated England to select.

With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkajärvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkajärvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper’s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It’s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than €250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey’s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you’d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they’re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair. VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.","Traditional sports in Scotland's Highland Games and Mongolia's Naadam .

8960977b4c0812a3e26747e6b384a0aa33050e17,"Olivier Giroud might have played a key role in Arsenal's Champions League exit against Monaco, but the French forward's form otherwise is as good as any other striker in Europe. Only Lionel Messi can match his statistics in 2015. Giroud has 11 goals in 15 games so far this calendar year, a ratio that puts him ahead of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo as one of Europe's leading marksmen and his strikes have helped Arsenal to become the Barclays Premier League's form team. Their French centre forward's impressive streak has helped Arsenal move to within a point of second-placed Manchester City and they look all-but certain to qualify for the Champions League in one of the most competitive battles for the top four in recent years. Olivier Giroud has been in fine form for Arsenal so far in 2015, notching 11 goals in just 15 appearances .

Messi, though, has 20 in 19 games averaging 0.95 goals per game. Even the prolific Harry Kane at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur cannot quite match Giroud. His 13 goals in 18 games in 2015 giving him a rate of 0.72, just slightly lower than the 28-year-old Frenchman. After scoring both goals in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Newcastle United, Giroud's efforts are being appreciated by his manager as well as his critics. Giroud gets ahead of Newcastle defender Mike Williamson to score the first of his two goals at the weekend . The French striker scored a second goal within four minutes, nodding in a corner with ease . Asked if Giroud is world-class, manager Arsene Wenger said: 'I think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it. But I believe there is still room for improvement. 'Technically, he is a much better player than he was. His touch, his link play, his finishing, they have all improved. If you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now, it is obvious he is a better player. 'He is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength. At 22 or 23 he played in Division Three in France, and now he is at Arsenal.' Arsene Wenger now ranks Giroud as world-class and says he has improved since joining Arsenal .

Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore. After emergency personnel reached Blum and her companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. Nancy Blum, 58, of San Francisco died on Saturday after falling 70 foot to her death when the Arch Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed into the sea .

The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death, reports SFGate. 'The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. Blum’s hiking companion continues to be treated for life-threatening injuries. The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. The National Park Service had posted signs at the site on Thursday warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was potentially dangerous. The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park  told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had seen dozens of people walking in the area.

762fba4e6b32734289238422d9420703c554a2e3,"Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for Sunday’s League Cup Final and called on critics of his Tannadice tackle on Nadir Ciftci to ‘man up’. The Parkhead skipper, whose heavy challenge on the Dundee United striker sparked a melee during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final at the weekend, is one of a number of players who will find out on Tuesday if they face retrospective action from the SFA. But, dismissing any concern, Brown said: ‘Am I worried about being cited? Not in the slightest. The referee was two yards away and he had a clear view of my tackle and he saw that I won the ball. Celtic's Scott Brown has accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head . ‘It was a great tackle. He was fine with it and so was the linesman. They saw what they saw and they made their decisions. ‘At the end of the day, it’s a man’s sport. People need to man up a bit. People moan about the tackles, but if the ball is there to be won, go and win it. As long as it’s not dangerous and you are not flying two-footed into somebody.’ In the wake of an absorbing 1-1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties, one of which was saved, the Tannadice club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder Paul Paton. The luckless Paton was the victim of mistaken identity by referee Craig Thomson, at the behest of assistant referee Graham Chambers, after his team-mate Calum Butcher clashed on the ground with Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk. But while Paton’s appeal on Thursday is expected to be straightforward, Van Dijk faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after Celtic also appealed his red card. Brown holds his head during the bad-tempered Scottish Cup quarter-final on Sunday afternoon . And in what is shaping up as a disciplinary D-Day, United trio Cifti, Butcher and Aidan Connolly will join Brown in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Ciftci appeared to kick Brown in the face following the Celtic man’s heavy challenge, while Butcher could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with van Dijk. Connolly, meanwhile, could face a simulation charge after Celtic boss Ronny Deila accused him of diving to win his team’s first half penalty kick, scored by Ciftci. Paul Dixon was the other sending off during Sunday’s match but United won’t contest that and he misses the Scottish Cup replay at Parkhead on March 18. After the cup match, United boss Jackie McNamara said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee Craig Thomson had sent off Brown for his initial challenge on Ciftci. The referee did not even give a foul but the Celtic captain – who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under-fire match officials – added: ‘I was kicked in the head (by Ciftci). You can blatantly see that. We will see what happens with that. At the time I didn’t know who it was. I felt a boot against my face. ‘There was so much going on at the time, I didn’t know who it was until I watched it again afterwards. ‘I’m probably lucky it was to my face, and not another part of my body. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . ‘Do I hope Virgil wins his appeal? That would be great but we will see. But I didn’t see that incident because I had (Ciftci’s) studs in my face at the time. You could see the marks, you still can.’ Brown, who was speaking at Lesser Hampden where he was publicising Sunday’s showpiece occasion, also backed up his boss Deila’s assertion that Connolly had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty. ‘It was a blatant dive,’ said Brown. ‘I was close by. Anthony (Stokes) put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down. ‘He played it really well. I will give him that but we had (Derk Boerrigter) get a two-match ban for that so I think it was dealt with rightly. You don’t want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not. It is not a nice part of the game.’ Brown refused to be critical of match officials Thomson and Chambers, and instead insisted video evidence would have cleared up the confusion. ‘I think yesterday would have been ideal for it,’ he said. ‘We stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that Paton got sent off. ‘If we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was. ‘It wouldn’t stop the game every two minutes, (only with) big decisions like that. We definitely need that.’","Dundee United and Celtic drew 1-1 at Tannadice on Sunday .

c42148a52e8cd58d5f67b89789c835c0f3e030e0,"Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules . Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham. A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed. No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found. The recall was issued in November,  and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched. The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested. 'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being. 'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.' Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment. The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community. 'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.' Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures . Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing. Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not in connected to this incident. A spokesman for NHS England said any former patients of Mr D'Mello who have not yet accessed testing and wish to do so should contact their GP. Many of his former patients are taking legal action against the dentist. Around 200 are building cases with legal firm the Dental Law Partnership. David Corless-Smith, a solicitor with the company, said last week: 'Desmond D'Mello was a master of five-minute dentistry and you can't do much that is going to last a long time in five minutes. 'We have 200 of Mr D'Mello's former patients bringing claims for nervous shock of being told they may have contracted a life-threatening infection but half of those are pursuing claims for poor treatment.'","Desmond D'Mello was suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .

18b2a91c9f4d7344b94edf542f5f6bf428cc1ca5,"Photographs of Yosemite's iconic Half Dome peak have revealed the astonishing extent of California's historic drought. The images, which show the peak in the third week of March each year between 2011 and 2015, reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year. The snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late March and, as seen in the 2011 photograph, it previously covered peaks including the Half Dome. But this year, the fourth consecutive year of drought in California, the 9,000-foot peak doesn't bear a single flake of snow. Earlier this month, officials reported that the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which gives an indication of upcoming water supply, is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991. The lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for California. Scroll down for video . Hidden: A photo taken by a Yosemite Conservancy webcam on March 19, 2011 shows Yosemite's Half Dome peak covered with snow . Depleting: The following year, in March 2012, the iconic peak is similarly covered in deep snow . In response, state regulators voted earlier this month to impose a new set of water conservation rules, such as bans on watering yards and stopping restaurants serving customers water unless they specifically ask for it. Farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted, nearly twice the amount of last year, the New York Times reported. 'It looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history,' state climatologists Michael Anderson told the Times. 'Unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in March, we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here.' But the Half Dome peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month. Earlier this month, the United States Department of Agriculture noted that as well as California, droughts are ravaging Nevada and Utah and also parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. The photographs were taken by the Yosemite webcam provided by Yosemite Conservancy, which is funded by donations. While all years show the peak on March 19, the 2014 image shows it on March 17 as a March 19 photograph was not available.

It was the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living residents, who are all in their 80s and 90s, who came up with the idea for a charity calendar that showed a little bit of skin. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, said the residents were inspired by a similar calendar another retirement center nearby had done. Wilma Purvis and Norma Elfrink were the centerfold for the stripped down charity calendar made by residents of the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living facility in Barberton, Ohio . 'They were so cute about it,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful.' Morris said the only thing her mother, who was Miss July, was worried about was getting her hair done before the shoot. The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme. Miss February, 87-year-old Dottie Rutter, lies in a bubble bath covered in rose petals as she enjoys a box of chocolates to honor Valentine's Day. The 98-year-old Maxine Garden, who  passed away after the shoot, can be seen smiling behind a large exercise ball, happy bare (almost) all in the facility's gym. The calendar's centerfold is Wilma Purvis, 94, and Norma Elfrink, 91, playing a game of poker with some very large cards - not to mention Coronas and cigars. Miss October Jean Genet (right), 90, told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said . Lifetime Barbertown resident and Miss October Jean Genet, 90, was a housewife before moving into Pleasant Pointe. She told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked. 'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said. She said none of the models said no to the shoot in December and that she 'felt glamorous' after taking off her clothes to pose in a witches hat. Mrs Genet was sad that her husband, who died in November, did not get to see the calendar. However, she said her whole family, which includes five daughters, 14 grandchilden and 30 great-grandchildren, have picked up copies. 'They can't believe that's grandma,' she said. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, told the Daily Mail Online the calendar 'wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful' The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme . Pleasant Pointe spokesperson Michelle Clapper said the residents were 'very excited' to be a part of the charity calendar, she told the Akron Beacon Journal. She said they were 'like 20-year-olds' on the morning of the big shoot, giggling and 'having the time of their lives'. 'I do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other,' she said. 'I want a fun environment. I love supporting their independence.' 'I wanted them to decide what they wanted to do,' said Morris. 'That's what we're here for.' Proceeds from the calendars, which are selling for $12, will held provide shoes for children who attend schools in the area. The residents recently donated $2,000 to the fund. Pleasant Pointe says that it has had to order more calendars to keep up with demand, according to WKYC. None of the residents had ever done any sort of naked modeling before.

Andrew Skarbek, 47, has been competing on the Channel 7 afternoon quiz Million Dollar Minute for 23 episodes. He defeated 46 contestants and answered more than 589 questions on his journey to becoming Australia's newest millionaire. ‘You can call it million dollar minute but its been more like a million dollar month.’ Mr Skarbek quipped to Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Host Simon Reeve, left, hands Andrew Skarbek, right, $1,016,000 making him the biggest cash prize winner in Australian television history . Andrew Skarbek said he tried to outsmart the producers, looking for his wife, knowing that she would only be there if he took out the big prize . Robert Menzies first became prime minister as leader of which party? a) UAP . b) DLP . c) NCP . Which of these singers is the eldest? a) Billy Joel . b) David Bowie . c) Bruce Springsteen . The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year? a) 1854 . b) 1856 . c) 1860 . Which of these teams was first to race in a Formula 1 Grand Prix . a) Tyrrell . b) Sauber . c) Jordan .

In the final nail-biting minute of the show he was asked the following historical question: 'The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year?' The trivia buff correctly answered '1860' but said it left like a 'lifetime' before the big green tick rolled around, signalling a triumphant end to an extremely nerve-racking month. As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Friday afternoon, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said although it would 'take a while to sink in', all he felt was overwhelming relief. ‘It’s incredible! I think at this stage it’s more relief than anything seeing as it's been such a long process,‘ Mr Skarbek said. He admitted it's been a 'hard slog' but he relished the challenge and knew he wanted to take it all the way. 'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it,' he said. Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million. ‘I know I could have lived with taking the risk. If you’re prepared and back yourself, you can live with loosing.' He was adamant that not knowing that would have eaten him alive. Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure. 'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. Becoming the longest standing contestant on the show Mr Skarbek spent 23 episodes on Million Dollar Minute in what he calls his 'million dollar month’ Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million. ‘I know I could have lived with taking the risk.

Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure. 'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. The humble winner said it was hard for him to believe he'd achieved 'permanent financial security and become the biggest winner in Australian quiz show history. 'It will change our lives but we are pretty down to earth and I know it wont change us.’ Mr Skarbek hit financial trouble after being diagnosed with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma which required an expensive twice-weekly blood transfusion. Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer . His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' With a 'life-changing' amount of money now sitting in his bank account Mr Skarbek said, after years of renting, he can't wait to become a home owner. 'When we were younger and had the chance to buy a house we could never find the perfect property. Then the market went berserk and although we were saving like crazy, we were shut out.’ ‘This will be the house that trivia built,’ he joked. After buying a home Mr Skarbek says he'll use some of the prize money to take his wife around the world . Having a good understanding what it's like to struggle financially Mr Skarbek said his wife was adamant they share their good fortune by making a generous donation to the Smith Family. 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Not only will they satisfy their own wanderlust with a trip around the word, Mr Skarbek said his mother hasn’t been back to her native Poland in 15 years and said he cant wait to send the 78-year-old home in style, on a business class flight. Mr Skarbek says his 78-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him and now it's his turn to repay the favour by sending her back to her native Poland for a holiday after 15 years . Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given . A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor' Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father. 'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. After spending 15 years in the energy industry Mr Skarbek said he can't wait to leave his job and spend some time relaxing with his family. ‘I have moments where I know it’s happened and I have moments where sometimes it feels like a dream.’ Mr Skarbek is the first Million Dollar Minute contestant to win the million dollar jackpot with his jackpot including $16,000 in ‘safe money’ he accumulated during the games.

0875a3a89684ad75bbb6dd9d5514ddd678828dca,"Should Rangers win promotion to the Premiership this season they will have to pay Newcastle United £500,000 as part of the loan deal struck with the St James' Park club for five players. The details emerged this morning as Rangers released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £2.89m for the six-month period to 31 December 2014. Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'. Haris Vuckic celebrates after scoring in Rangers' 4-1 victory against Cowdenbeath on Saturday . This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far. Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs. The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000. Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Loan signings Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete are unveiled at Murray Park last month . Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. Paul Murray (left) and Dave King are pictured back at Ibrox after the EGM earlier this month . 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'","Rangers will owe Newcastle United £500,000 if they win promotion .

Joint research by Ipsos and PayPal, conducted in the past 12 months on 1001 respondents, found that more than half of those who had considered returning an unwanted item had failed to do so mainly due to shipping costs. Other factors also included unnecessary hassle  or complicated returns processes.

64668be8e1bb358321f4ef62bd11db815df27cf0,"(CNN)The family of an unarmed biracial 19-year-old killed by police in Madison, Wisconsin, is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets. ""Our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew, and we are all left to deal with the aftermath,"" Turin Carter, the teen's uncle, told reporters on Monday. Carter stressed that his family wasn't anti-police, but said Tony Robinson's death ""highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males."" But he said the problem goes beyond the chants of ""black lives matter"" that have already been used at protests over the case. ""I encourage everybody to show support regardless of race because this is truly a universal issue. ... We don't want to stop at just 'black lives matter,' because all lives matter,"" he said. The deadly confrontation has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests. Here's what we know about the Friday night shooting. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Tony Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later, the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends. No weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Officer Matt Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Koval said it's understandable why protesters are outraged. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used,"" he said. A neighbor in the duplex said she heard it all happen. Two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex, and Robinson was their friend, Kathy Bufton said. ""I heard rustling and things being knocked over and my kitchen ceiling actually kind of shook. ... I figured something was going on,"" she said. ""I heard somebody go down the stairs. And then I heard the shots."" There were 4-6 shots fired, Bufton said. For the family, that's a horrifying reality. ""It takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life. It takes one bullet,"" Carter said Monday. ""And we know how many were fired."" This isn't the first time Kenny used lethal force. In 2007, he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a ""suicide by cop."" Kenny was exonerated of wrongdoing and received a commendation. During the confrontation Friday night, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. ""It's a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation,"" said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. ""The real fear for any officer when he's being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away,"" Palmer said, ""and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly."" Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. His mother, Andrea Irwin, painted a different picture of the teen: ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she told CNN affiliate WKOW. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" The police chief refused to comment on Robinson's criminal history or run-ins with police. ""I could but I choose not to,"" he said at a press conference Saturday. ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his."" On Monday, Robinson's uncle told reporters his nephew wasn't a saint and had made some poor decisions, but was still a ""good, kindhearted kid."" ""We paint him as a human being, a 19-year-old who made a terrible mistake at one point, which is completely dissociated from this act,"" he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, who said he met with Robinson's family the night of the shooting, said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial. ""That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" ""We know that he was not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned ... the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy."" Because Robinson did not have a weapon, the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: ""Black lives matter."" Asked the difference between Ferguson and Madison, Carter said Monday the cases are ""similar, but different,"" noting that his nephew's ""racial ambiguity"" was an important part of his identity. ""Tony's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that America's racial lines are completely, 100% blurred,"" he said. ""My sister is a white mother of black children who had black and white relatives. We are all multiple races and we each have our own complex heritage."" Among the protesters are members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. ""In light of so many things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" Chief Koval told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he knows it may be difficult for Madison to move forward after Robinson's death. He visited the teen's grandmother over the weekend but was advised by them to not visit the mother yet because the emotions are still too raw. ""We need to start, as any healing or any reconciliation should, with an 'Im sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years, if at all, to mend,"" the police chief said. ""But the effort has to be there. So we have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring the community back into the fold, as it were."" CNN's Rosa Flores, Gary Tuchman, Brianna Keilar, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Uncle: The shooting highlights ""systematic targeting of young black males""

Then, after bleaching her hair for the third time in three weeks, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was spotted sporting damaged locks while out with husband Kanye and daughter North. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a hasty ponytail and strands had fallen out and blew listlessly in the ocean breeze on the Malibu family outing on Sunday. Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Jose, ambassador for Salon Science, had warned that if she's not careful, Kim could suffer some serious breakage due to her blonde preference. Later that day: Kim was spotted clocking in some gym time . Zip up: The star wore a figure hugging jacket . Andrew, who has styled the tresses of Alanis Morissette, Jamie Campbell Bower and Louise Redknapp, said: 'This type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high-end and powerful. 'Be warned though, this look is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.' He added: 'Overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle. 'This may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft.' Cool customer: Kim was dressed in all black as she slicked her dark locks into a tight pony tail .","She debuted her platinum-blonde locks on March 5, in time for Paris Fashion Week .

8e649128b35c9696a8547197d09db3bfd8f3afdb,"According to some accounts, the wealth of the ancient Roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre. Even the founder of the Roman empire, Emperor Augustus claimed that he had 'found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble'. But new research by historians at the University of California Los Angeles has now cast doubt on this boast. Scroll down to explore ancient Rome in 3D . This reconstruction by historians at the University of California shows how Rome would have looked under the rule of Augustus and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick (shown in grey) while only a few temples were constructed from marble (pink) Using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of Augustus between 44BC and 14AD. The Pantheon, Trajan's Market and the Colosseum have remained standing for nearly 2,000 years. Scientists claim to have found a 'secret' ingredient in Roman concrete that helped it endure the elements. Using X ray beams at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), researchers were able to study a reproduction of Roman volcanic ash-lime mortar. In the concrete walls of Trajan's Markets, constructed around 110 CE, this mortar binds cobble-sized fragments of tuff and brick. Scientists looked at the mineralogical changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 year old samples of the original. The team discovered that the volcanic ash creates a crystal structure that prevents tiny cracks from spreading. They also found that the use of strätlingite crystals in the material showed no corrosion, with their smooth surface suggesting stability. They found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in Rome at the time were converted from brick into marble. Indeed, the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape, meaning many historical discriptions of the city's beauty were perhaps exaggerated. Their discovery suggests that the claim attributed to Augustus may have been more of a metaphor than a literal boast. Dr Diana Favro, who led the work, said: 'Many scholars have looked at Augustus’ claim from a political standpoint, as a metaphor for him transforming a republic into an empire. 'I wanted to see if Rome literally transformed under his rule. Given the literary descriptions and artwork, I thought these glittering marble temples on high would be very visible, but they were not.' Dr Favro used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during Emperor Augustus' rule. Buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown. Those under construction were yellow. When the researchers examined the model, they found just a few buildings were clad with marble, including the Temple of Venus and the Basilica Julia. Dr Favro found that when viewed from the street level, however, these buildings were not widely visible. Shortly before Augustus came to power, the Carrara marble quarries on the northwest coast of Italy were opened, and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material. Augustus commissioned several large marble structures, some of which took 40 years to complete. As a result, massive marble blocks were constantly being moved through the city, causing congestion in the streets. Marble-paved public spaces, which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite, were also added throughout the city. The 3D model (above) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between 44BC and 14AD . The Basilica Julia in the Roman Forum was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in Rome under Emperor Augustus . Dr Favro said this may be why Rome earned its reputation as a city of marble. She said: 'Because they saw construction taking place constantly, I believe people really did think that Rome had been transformed into marble. 'But in reality, the city did not greatly transform.' Many artworks, like the painting above, and historical accounts depict Rome under Augustus as being dominated by marble buildings .","Emperor Augustus boasted about how his rule left Rome 'a city of marble' while historical accounts said it glittered .

Dan Diaz was lying in the bed beside his 29-year-old wife when she drank medication to end her life last month. Having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer just six months before, Maynard became the face of America's Right To Die campaign after moving from California to Oregon and setting a date for her own death. Now, her widower is continuing that battle calling for all states to approve legislation that supports life-ending options for people with terminal illnesses. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'It was peaceful and loving': Dan Diaz has spoken to Oprah about his final moments with Brittany Maynard . Passed away: Diaz's wife controversially chose to end her life with lethal medication last month . Campaign: Maynard documented her final six months and fought for relaxed laws on the right to die . Launching his campaign, Diaz met with Oprah and explained how Maynard chose seven of her closest friends and relatives - and their dogs Bella and Charlie - to stand around the bed in her final moments. 'The mood in the house was very peaceful, very loving,' he said in an interview that will be screened on Sunday. Glassy-eyed, he said each person recited a memory to her before she said her own goodbyes. 'She actually wrote on Facebook a message to her friends and said ""I love you"" to everyone, to me. 'The medication, we brought it in. She was ready.' Love: The couple married in California but later moved to Oregon where Maynard could end her life . Memories: Diaz said Maynard got seven friends and relatives to each tell her a memory . Diaz is continuing the campaign that Maynard started as he lobbies for new legislation . Maynard's two dogs were in the bed with them when she drank the lethal medicine, Diaz said . Then, she drank the lethal cocktail prescribed by her doctor. 'Within five minutes, she fell asleep. It was very peaceful.' It comes after Debbie Ziegler, Brittany Maynard's mom, wrote an article for DailyMail.com describing the moment she watched her only daughter die. 'Brittany, my beautiful, brave girl, had passed away purposefully and peacefully just as she planned. Death had been kind, graceful even, and spared Brittany a great deal of physical pain and mental anguish. 'It was a good death.' A mother's tears: Debbie Ziegler, Maynard's mother, is also campaigning to change laws . Joining Diaz in the campaign for euthanasia, she added: 'But what does a good death look like in America: the land of death phobia? Americans do not like to talk about death. Some say a good death is a natural death, but they often mean dying “in their sleep.” 'Modern medicine has made death seem like a medical failure instead of the natural end of life. The death of a 29-year-old is unthinkable. All of life looms ahead, full of promise. 'We found ourselves as a family: choosing between no more treatment and death – or a treatment plan that felt like torture and then death anyway only a few months later.' Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since. According to state statistics compiled through Dec. 31, 2013: . — People who have used the law since late 1997: 752 (396 men, 356 women) — People younger than 35 who have used the law: 6 . — Median age of the deceased: 71 . — Percentage of the deceased who were white: 97 . — Percentage who had at least some college: 72 . — Percentage of patients who informed relatives of their decision: 94 . — Percentage of patients who died at a home: 95 percent . — Median minutes between ingestion of lethal drug and unconsciousness: 5 . — Median minutes between ingestion and death: 25 . — Number of terminally ill people who have moved to Oregon to die: unknown .","Dan Diaz, widower of Brittany Maynard, is campaigning for Right To Die .

However, the 11-year-old's teacher parents, Bruce and Linda Bays, have said that three field tests proved their son did not have a leaf from the plant. A Virginia middle school student received a 364-day suspension last September, after school officials said they found him with a marijuana leaf. Speaking to the Roanoke Times, the Bays said there are varying accounts of the September 22 incident involving their son, identified as R.M.B. The couple said they'd heard the boy, who at the time was enrolled in Bedford Middle School's gifted and talented program, had displayed the leaf in a school bathroom, in his homeroom in another account, and while riding the school bus in yet another version. An assistant principal later searched the boy's backpack and pulled out both a lighter and a leaf, before he asked a school resource officer -  who is a deputy for the sheriff's office - to step in, according to the newspaper. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'I asked, ""Can I see the leaf?"" and the deputy said, ""No, it’s already in evidence."" We have never seen the leaf. He’s been out of school for six months.' R.M.B. received an immediate ten-day suspension, before the nearly year-long suspension was issued during a September administrative hearing, the newspaper reported. The Bays told the Roanoke Times that at a November juvenile court hearing, they found out about the leaf's multiple negative test results - and that a prosecutor planned to drop their son's marijuana possession charge. Linda Bays told the newspaper 'I immediately sent a letter to [the school's operations chief Dr. Frederick Duis] requesting a new hearing,' and claimed he told her 'The court system and the school system were two different entities.' The Roanoke Times reported that the couple has sued both the school district and the sheriff's office, claiming school officials violated their son's constitutional due process rights and that the sheriff's office committed malicious prosecution. The Bays told the Roanoke Times their son is being treated by a psychiatrist for depression and panic attacks, and is now anxious regarding being in public. Attorney Jim Guynn, who's representing both defendants, told the newspaper that the resource officer thought the leaf was from a marijuana plant. 'It’s the same punishment and exactly the same result,' Guynn told the Roanoke Times regarding how the school deals with fake drugs and real ones identically. The Bays told the newspaper that their son's denied any wrongdoing multiple times. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'Why would you want an 11-year-old gifted-and-talented student out of school for 364 days?'

The tour group and their guide were making their way down the river between Zimbabwe and Zambia when they saw crocodiles feeding. But as they approached, it became clear that the reptiles were tearing apart the bottom half of a human. Horrified British tourists saw crocodiles eating a man on the banks of the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe (file picture) The Daily Telegraph reports that the tourists alerted authorities - but by the time officials had arrived to investigate, the remains of the body had vanished. It quotes a local source as saying: 'All there was to see of him was his trousers. We have had no information about anyone missing from villages around us, so we don't think the man was a local.' Trevor Lane of Zimbabwean conservation group, the Bhejane Trust, said the body was believed to have been a Zambian man. He is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in Zimbabwe just days earlier. Mr Lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to Zambia. When the tourists approached the crocodiles they could see that the reptiles were eating the bottom half of a human (file picture) He reportedly told the South African Press Association: 'We strongly suspect it was a poacher.

b137b9fea5c50478c2a1300b38759c87b87c18c0,"(CNN)The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez said at a hearing Friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her Massachusetts home after the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Shayanna Jenkins' testimony came outside the presence of the jury during a hearing on the limits of her testimony. But it signaled where the prosecution intends to take its questioning of the key witness, who took the stand before the jury later Friday. She is testifying after being granted immunity. Hernandez, the ex-tight end who had a $40 million contract until he was charged with murder, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. ""You took that box out and concealed it. Were you attempting to do it in a way so that people didn't know what you were doing?"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked. ""That's correct,"" Jenkins said. The weapon in the case has not been recovered. The prosecution has said Hernandez's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their North Attleboro home after Lloyd was killed on June 17, 2013. The state also alleges that she lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the home. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins testified she was ""instructed"" to take the box out of the home, and that it was ""important"" for her to get rid of it. On the day after Lloyd's killing, prosecutors have said Jenkins received a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants said Hernandez asked his fiancée to remove something from their basement. The text message said: ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" Asked about the text message Friday afternoon, in the presence of the jury, Jenkins said she didn't know what it meant. Jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance's two alleged accomplices in the killing of Lloyd and gave them $500 in cash as police were questioning Hernandez about the slaying. Jenkins testified that she took Hernandez to a police station on June 18, 2013, and that he asked her to give Wallace money. Wallace was comforting to her, Jenkins told the jury. ""He said everything would be OK,"" she said. She went to a bank ATM and withdrew $500 to give Wallace. ""I don't remember the dollar amount he asked for but I remember telling him that was the amount I could take out,"" she testified. Hours after Lloyd's death, Jenkins said, Hernandez appeared ""normal"" and his two alleged accomplices appeared ""fine."" Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Her sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. At one point, McCauley asked Jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home. She told the jury that she saw one ""in the kitchen junk drawer."" Prosecution witnesses have testified that Lloyd was shot to death with a .45-caliber Glock handgun. McCauley approached Jenkins on the stand with a Glock similar to the one used in the murder. ""Is that a secured firearm?"" she asked, moving back slightly. ""Yes."" McCauley asked if the Glock's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer. ""Yes,"" she responded. ""Color?"" ""Yes."" Size? ""I'm not sure,"" she told the jury. Jenkins' testimony resumes next week. CNN's Lawrence Crook III and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez is on trial in the death of Odin Lloyd .

Scroll down for video . Happy birthday, Sophia! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland celebrated daughter Sophia's first birthday by creating a farmyard for the tiny tot in the garden of their London mansion . Birthday girl: Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pyjamas on Instagram with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life' Zebras, sheep, puppies and ponies were just some of the animals that were seen arriving at the family home, which had been kitted out with pink balloons crafted into 'S' shapes in honour of the youngster. Each animal had its very own station complete with a gazebo and pink name sign and a balloon artist was also seen making his way into the family home. On Tuesday morning, Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pajamas on Instagram. The picture of the tiny tot wearing the outfit, which was emblazoned with her name and the number '1', was captioned with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life.' Fit for a princess: The entrance to the house was transformed into a balloon castle emblazoned with giant 'S' letters in the child's honour . Welcome to the farmyard: Each animal had its own station complete with a pink sign with its name on and a princess crown . Enjoying her special day: Tamara's little daughter Sophia seemed to be enjoying her special day in this Instagram shot of her playing with her new presents . Which was is the party? Guests and animal experts made their way into the event armed with little puppies on leads . Disneyland comes to London: Tamara even invited a real life princess along to join in the celebrations at her family home . Speaking about the event, Steven Duggan, who didn't organise this event but has organised events for the likes of Elton John and Adele, believes the event could have cost around £70,000. He said: 'This is a beautiful setting for Sophia on her birthday. 'We have done similar 1st birthday parties for high end clientele like Tamara Ecclestone before where our clients spent upwards of £70,000. It's a first birthday, if you can spoil them why not! It looks magical; a perfect fairytale party!'. Formerly of the party-girl persuasion, Tamara is embracing a more quiet life with open arms, confessing that 'parenting is so much better than going out partying'. And although Tamara  is clearly loving having a little girl, she does admit that it does come with its less-than-glamorous challenges. Speaking to new! magazine about the joys of being a parent, she admitted that there are moments that are rather embarrassing. 'After having a baby, all your dignity goes out of the window!' she joked, adding that some of her most mortifying moments in her first year of having a baby include 'breast leakage' and 'poo on her jeans'.

'The love that you feel is so much deeper,' she said. 'I don't have tolerance for bulls**t now. I don't waste time with fakeness. Sophia's my priority. She's really turned my life upside down – for the better.' The beautiful brunette socialite also opened up about the fact she and husband Jay Rutland are still sharing a bed with their tot, but that it's not a problem for them. Speaking in an interview with Hello magazine last year, Tamara - who gave birth to Sophia last March, her first child - revealed that she was a 'hands-on' mother even though she admitted it can be tiring. 'I'm totally exhausted all the time, but I don't care because it's a happy exhaustion,' she explained. 'I'm not drinking or having coffee and I'm being so healthy for Sophia. 'I'm sorry, but I'm completely obsessed with Sophia. I love her so much I'm like a crazy woman.' Tamara and her daughter were last week spotted enjoying a day out in Hyde Park, where they were duck spotting. Their little outing came just before Tamara and husband Jay and their daughter flew out to Milan for another of their many getaways, before also taking a 24-hour round-trip from the city to the glorious Lake Como in the north of Italy. Little Sophia was blissfully unaware of her luxury surrounding as she boarded a private plane with her mother. Jay, to whom Tamara has been married since 2013, chose to celebrate his 34th birthday with the quick getaway in the idyllic location, where they enjoyed a night at the Villa D’Este Hotel .

As its shadow engulfs the beach, the sheer size of the aircraft dwarfs the tourists underneath it, who pose for photographs and watch in awe. Seemingly closer than usual, the wheels look like they could be touched as turning heads follow its movement and numerous tablets and smart phones capture its landing. Passing the fence and arriving inside the airport, the plane’s wheels appear to narrowly miss a taxi, which drives on by as if nothing ever happened. Maho Beach is located on the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, in the territory of Sint Maarten. Aircraft are forced to land so close to the beach so as to touch down near the start of the short Runway 10, which is 2,300 metres in length. As a result the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables. Planes are required to fly low when approaching the airport so as to get as close to the start of the short Runway 10 .

The row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on January 7, according to the Times. It has reportedly made £21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000-a-week rocketed to hundreds of thousands. Now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor's parents - to be divided equally. Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Terror: On January 7, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi raided the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris and killed 11 people, sparking a string of terror attacks across the city . As many as 11 employees have instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine - which has published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad on its cover - into a workers' cooperative. It would mean they all have a stake in the company but their move has been attacked by another anonymous contributor in a leaked email to French news agency Agence France-Presse. The unnamed contributor accused the plotters of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier 'before the worms have finished eating him'. 40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents, another 40 by the magazine's new editor Laurent Sourisseau and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director Eric Portheault. One of the magazine's journalists Laurent Léger said: 'A new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible.' And Patrick Pelloux - who writes a column for Charlie Hebdo - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper. He said: 'When a company has been decimated, you feel completely tied to it. It is not a question of sharing the cake. The money does not interest us.' However a spokesman for Sourisseau and Portheault said: 'All this money is doing more harm than good. Greedy: An unnamed contributor has accused staff of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured) 'before the worms have finished eating him' Demand: Since the brutal attack on Charlie Hebdo in January, the magazine's usual circulation of 30,000 a week has boomed to hundreds of thousands . 'It makes you think of those funerals where everyone is fighting over the grandmother's jewellery on the way back from the cemetery.' He added that the owners had promised not to pay themselves dividends for three years and wanted to ensure the £3million received in donations after the attack went to victims' families. 'We note the desire of the staff to be associated with the life of the newspaper. But we are a long way from thinking about the make-up of the shareholders.' This is not the first time that Charlie Hebdo has been split over financial matters. In 2008, it's then-editor Philippe Val faced a backlash when it emerged he paid himself dividends of over £200,000 when sale rose following the controversial publication of issues featuring the Propher Muhammad.","Staff instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine into a workers' cooperative .

The images, understood to have been taken in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being dragged out onto a public square in front of a bloodthirsty crowd. The blindfolded victim is forced to sit in a chair in the centre of the square, where he is held in place by one of the jihadis, while two others use a large meat cleaver to brutally sever his hand from his arm. Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike . Horror: The images, understood to have been taken in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16 . The horrific images were shared on the Twitter page of the local  activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the city to expose the atrocities committed by ISIS. The four photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. The first image shows the blindfold and baseball cap-wearing victim being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed Islamic State terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16. Another shot captures a bearded cleric appearing to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man is accused of stealing. The victim is then seen pinned in a chair by a separate group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike. A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand. Accusations: A bearded cleric appears to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the gathered crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man has been accused of stealing . Painful: A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand . The video comes just one day after ISIS released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based  in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria. Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. It also carries the logo of one of the group's official Aleppo-based propaganda arms, Halab. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.","Victim is dragged before bloodthirsty onlookers in the Syrian city of Raqqa .

abe98d249635957aa445df015a79241cf383bfc5,"Dame Jane Goodall has condemned politicians for pushing 'Frankenstein Food' Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned primate expert, has condemned ‘deluded’ politicians for pushing ‘Frankenstein Food’. The highly respected academic has endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers. Historically, critics of GM food have been lambasted by the GM companies, scientists who rely on their funding, and politicians, including the UK Government, as being ‘anti-science’. However, Dame Jane argues that the advocates of GM food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘anti-science’. The intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, have forced GM crops and food on to dinner plates in the US without proper safety tests. And she is joining a growing campaign warning that Britain and Europe must not drop safeguards that have kept GM crops out. Dame Jane’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book, ‘Altered Genes, Twisted Truth’, which is written by the American public interest lawyer, Steve Druker. Its publication comes as the US is seeing a growing backlash against GM. Just last week it emerged that the country’s favourite chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, is to drop GM from its products. Dame Jane said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet’. She said the GM process, which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them. However, she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘fraud’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding. She said: ‘This very real difference between GM plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure. As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. ‘They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that the new foods were safe. Yet this, as Druker points out, was clearly not true.’ Importantly, she claims, the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support. ‘Druker describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminent scientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.’ Dame Jane is considered to be the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She is best known for her 55-year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. She was made a Dame in 2004 and holds many other awards for her environmental and humanitarian work, including the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, the French Legion of Honour, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, Japan’ s Kyoto Prize and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. The British government has signalled that it plans to use a new GM crop approval process to push ahead with growing the crops in this country. Separately, a new trade agreement between the EU and the USA, which is called TTIP, could make it much easier for GM foods from North America to appear on shelves here. However, Dame Jane warns it would be an enormous risk to accept the technology and describes Mr Druker as a hero worthy of a Nobel prize for lifting the lid on the truth about GM. Dame Jane endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers (file picture) She describes his work as one of the most important books of the last 50 years, and adds: ‘It will go a long way toward dispelling the confusion and delusion that has been created regarding the genetic engineering process and the foods it creates. ‘Although this book tells a story that’s in many ways distressing, it’s important that it has finally been told because so much confusion has been spread and so many important decision-makers have apparently been deluded.’ Mr Druker, who gave a press conference in London yesterday(wed), has challenged Britain’s Royal Society to apologies for its pro-GM stance and its part in rubbishing scientists who have safety doubts over the crops and food. His work points to research which has found tumours, liver and kidney harm in animals given GM feed in trials. And he complains, that researchers who dare to raise these problems have been pilloried. He said: ‘Contrary to the assertions of its proponents, the massive enterprise to reconfigure the genetic core of the world’s food supply is not based on sound science but on the systematic subversion of science – and it would collapse if subjected to an open airing of the facts.’ Pat Thomas, director of the campaigning group Beyond GM, warned the TTIP trade talks mean Britain and Europe could see a flood of biotech crops and food arriving here. She said: ‘Steven Druker’s investigation into the history of fraud and deceit that ushered in the era of GM deserves serious consideration before we take actions that will irreversibly alter the European food supply’. Dr Julian Little a spokesman for Bayer CropScience was not aware of Drunker's book. He said: 'We are now up to the three trillion meals and counting, that is meals containing GM ingredients, without a single substantial health issue since the beginning of the technology. 'There has been much dirt thrown but none of it has stuck.' On its website Monsanto say they place the 'highest priority' on the safety of their products and conduct 'rigorous and comprehensive testing on each.' They state: 'In fact, seeds with GM traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals. 'In addition, governmental regulatory agencies, scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree on the safety of GM crops.' A spokesman for the company added: 'The denial of the safety of GM seeds and food ingredients is as baseless as the denial of clearly documented climate change. 'Countless peer-reviewed scientific studies performed with biotech crops — including more than 100 feeding studies — have confirmed their safety, as reflected in the respective safety assessments by regulatory authorities around the world.'","Dr Jane Goodall argues supporters of GM food ignored evidence of harm .

His conviction follows the sentencing of two other men, Noman Qureshi, 32, from Bradford, and Israr Khan, 35, from Luton, in October last year. They were sentenced to 21 and 18 years respectively. The smugglers did not realise they were already under surveillance by a crack team from the National crime Agency soon after the container ship arrived at the port in Suffolk in December 2013 . On the evening of Friday 6 December 2013, Qureshi drove from his home in Bradford, picked up Khan in Luton, and drove to a hotel in Ilford. Sami arrived in his Porsche 911 to meet with them to discuss where to unload the heroin from the car. The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was driven on the back of a low-loader to an address in Dagenham during the early hours of 7 December . Qureshi and Khan met it, but shortly after left the scene. They were arrested later that morning in Luton. The Jaguar was seized and examined by specialist Border Force search officers. They recovered 316 separate packages of heroin totalling 230 kilos. If cut and sold the drugs would have had a likely potential street value of £37.2 million. Sami was arrested in February 2014. NCA investigators linked him to a phone that had regularly been used to contact Qureshi prior to the heroin importation. The Class A drug was packed into the boot (pictured), dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Even the car's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul . Black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats, removed by police . Paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the UK to be repaired. But investigators were able to find the drugs after the Jaguar was scanned with X-ray equipment, and its secret cargo was revealed . Jailed: Noman Qureshi of Bradford, West Yorkshire (right), was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan of Luton, Bedfordshire (left) was given an 18-year sentence. Police said they were part of an international crime group . National Crime Agency Branch Commander David Norris said: 'Sami played a crucial part in this conspiracy - his role would have been to recover the drugs concealed within the car. 'This group had international contacts and planned to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK in what was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. 'The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin. 'But they were unaware their moves were being monitored by NCA investigators, who prevented them from putting these harmful drugs on the streets.'","Attique Sami was third member of drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed .

The 35-year-old midfielder, who has played more games than any player in Barca’s history and won every honour possible, will join Manchester City’s MLS franchise at the end of this season ready to start playing for them in 2016. Xavi (centre) celebrates after collecting the second of his three Champions League medals in 2009 . The veteran midfielder (left) has only been a bit-part player under Luis Enrique this season at Barca . Spanish radio station Cadena SER reported on Wednesday that the player, his father Joaquín and his agent Ivan Corretja met with a representative from the club at the L'Arrosseria Xàtiva restaurant in Barcelona just a stone’s throw from the Nou Camp to negotiate his move to the US. Xavi looked set to leave Barcelona last summer but decided to stay for one more season after a conversation with coach Luis Enrique. Despite that commitment he has played only a small role this campaign and played no part in Barcelona’s 2-1 victory over Manchester City last week. His departure from Barcelona will mark the end of an era. He joined the club as an 11-year-old and went on to make more than 700 appearances. He has won seven La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. Xavi's former Barcelona team-mate David Villa (above) is already at New York City . Ex-England midfielder Frank Lampard is unveiled at the new MLS franchise in July 2014 . It was Pep Guardiola who famously said of the young midfielder he saw coming through Barcelona’s youth system: ‘This player will retire me’. He ended up playing alongside him briefly before leaving the club and returning to build a team around the Spain star who also played 133 times for his country. Xavi's signing for New York City is a major coup and will also reunite him with former Spain and Barcelona team-mate David Villa, who will be expected to thrive on the service offered him by Xavi, and Lampard who also joins the MLS new boys after winning 11 major trophies at Chelsea in a 13-year period.","Xavi's Barcelona contract expires in the summer .

The Republic of Ireland manager said it would be understandable for some of his squad to be lacking in confidence but stressed the importance of being fully focused when the Group D leaders arrive in Dublin. O’Neill has had to contend with a couple of injuries to personnel already this week — Darron Gibson sat out training again with a groin complaint while James McClean will go for a scan on an ankle problem — while also attempting to boost the morale of players currently feeling the heat at their clubs.

John O'Shea has suffered a dismal season and is involved in a relegation fight with Sunderland . James McClean (right) is an injury doubt and will have a scan on his ankle before making a decision . ‘That’s the nature of it, I wouldn’t get too concerned,’ said O’Neill. ‘Someone asked me quite rightly about whether I’d be concerned about three or four players going into the side and of course you would, it would stand to reason. It is what it is. ‘I wouldn’t be too concerned, though. The players are up, ready to go, there’s a good enthusiasm around them. ‘A month or six weeks ago you start to formulate a few plans but you know those disappear when you pick up a few injuries along the way or maybe some people have a bit of club form. ‘Some players are coming in absolutely fine form, others have had trials and tribulations at club level which is a bit of a concern but I think put that to the side, just think of us. ‘Just think of the game ahead. If you are coming in great form, then fantastic. If it’s not, then don’t worry.’ Sunderland’s John O’Shea and Aston Villa’s Ciaran Clark are in a Premier League relegation fight and even though Everton trio Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Gibson won last week, the Toffees remain close to the drop zone.

So we’ll try and do a wee bit of that in the course of the week. ‘We’re training at the Aviva [today] and that should be good. It will give us a feeling about it again.’ On the injury front, O’Neill also revealed that Gibson is ‘concerned’ by his groin problem and that Stephen Ward did not have an operation on his ankle and will have a second scan before determining his plan of action.

Bad weather  prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor. His home near Camp Lejeune was within earshot of dull booming sounds of artillery or other heavy weapons. Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders (left) and Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn (right) Born in Bonn, Germany, Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, enlisted in the Marines after graduating from high school in Virginia. Following basic training in 1999, he was assigned to Camp LeJeune. He deployed to Kosovo and served with special operations teams in Iraq and Afghanistan before years before joining a Marine Corps special operations unit in 2010. He spent eight months as a liaison to Army Special Operations Command before joining his Middle East-focused regiment four years ago. He was married to a fellow Marine based at Camp Lejeune, and the couple has one son, according to an award by the Marine Corps Association & Foundation naming Saunders its special forces operator of 2014. Born in Reading, England, Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn, 33, moved to Queens, New York in 2002. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006. After boot camp, he was assigned to Camp Lejeune. He served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the Marine Corps' special operations force in 2011 and returning to Afghanistan in 2012. Flynn's heroism was honored by receiving three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals with Valor and the Bronze Star with Valor. Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III (left) and Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol (right) Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III, 31, was from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Ridge High School, where he was student government president and captain of the varsity lacrosse team. He attended the United States Naval Academy and became a commissioned Marine officer upon graduation in 2006. He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. He served two tours of duty in Iraq in 2007 and 2009, according to information provided by the Marines at Camp Lejeune. His career took him to Japan, where he became the deputy camp commander of a jungle warfare training center on Okinawa in 2011. He graduated from the Malaysian army's jungle warfare course and then joined the Marine special forces. Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol of Warren, Michigan, ""loved everything about the military,"" said his sister, Brandy Peek. 'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be,' Peek said. The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois. Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said.

He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a ""proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,"" she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean — he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted ""best smile"" by his senior class. He graduated in 2005. He started as an artillery mechanic, and his military merit led to three quick promotions. He completed training in special operations in 2012 and spent seven months in Afghanistan before returning in June. Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. A small memorial stands in the sand along Highway 98 in Navarre, Florida . 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. American flags stand in the median near the bridge entrance to Navarre Beach, Florida . A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.","The identities of the seven Marines killed in a helicopter crash off the coast of Florida this week have been revealed .

788fd4b82375fa3cf5cbe3ef6fcbacbc693a0a3c,"(CNN)Lee Kuan Yew will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito-ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets, shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government. Born in 1923, Lee became Prime Minister in 1959 when Singapore, a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of Chinese, Malays and Indians, was still British territory and beset by riots and unrest. He presided over Singapore's bitter split from Malaysia in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today. ""I was trying to create, in a third-world situation, a first-world oasis,"" Lee told CNN in 2008. READ MORE: Obama: 'Lee a visionary' Lee's thinking also had an international impact. His brand of capitalism -- which stresses the role of government rather than the free hand of the market -- has provided a blueprint for China's landmark economic reforms. But Lee was also a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents. In 2013, protests over plans to allow more immigrants into the city-state indicated growing unease among Singaporeans about the vision of the country set forth by the People's Action Party -- the party co-founded by Lee that has ruled Singapore for five decades. Lee voluntarily stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, the first Asian strongman to do so. However, he played a role in the country's Cabinet until 2011 when his eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong, was elected for a second term as prime minister. The elder Lee retained his influence around the world. ""This is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said during a meeting with Lee at the White House in October 2009. ""He is somebody who helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle,"" Obama added. But there were indications Lee's health had been slipping in recent years. In 2010 he was admitted to the hospital with a chest infection and in early 2013, Lee -- then 89 -- was hospitalized and treated treated for ""stroke-like symptoms."" He was again admitted to the hospital on February 5 for severe pneumonia and more than six weeks later remained on a ventilator. A fourth-generation Singaporean, Lee's family originally emigrated from southern China. A bright student, he gained a place in the city's elite Raffles Institution and went on to study law at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge. He attributed his decision to go into politics to his experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. ""I learned how people survived and how people had to submit because you need to eat and your family needs to live, so I learned the meaning of power,"" he told CNN in 2002. The city Lee took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today's Singapore. However, Lee told CNN he had no ""great vision of transformation."" He concentrated on attracting investment and creating jobs; first finding a successful niche in electronics manufacturing by touting Singapore as an alternative to Hong Kong, which he said was in turmoil due to the Cultural Revolution in China. While Lee has been lauded for his economic accomplishments, he also created a Singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum. The country ranks 150th in Reporters Without Borders' 2014 Media Freedom Index, putting it just above the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mexico and Iraq. The New York Times, The Economist, the International Herald Tribune and the Asian Wall Street Journal have all been targeted with the ""judicial harassment"" employed by the Lee family, according to the media watchdog. In a 2014 article for CNN, opposition politician Dr. Chee Soon Juan criticized Singapore's authoritarian system, blaming a lack of dissenting views for economic inequality and worsening working conditions. ""The ranks of the opposition, civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution, and nearly every newspaper, TV channel and radio station is owned and run by the state,"" Chee said. But in a 2008 interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Lee rebuffed charges that Singapore was too domineering or coercive a state. ""I want social peace and stability within the country. I am not following any prescription given to me by any theoretician on democracy,"" he said. While Lee is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many Singaporeans, a younger generation, with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country's birth, is questioning the Lee dynasty's control of Singaporean politics and pushing for greater democracy. In 2011, the People's Action Party lost six seats to the opposition, prompting Lee, then the party's ""minister mentor"" and another former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, to resign. In a joint letter to parliament, the two explained they ""decided to leave the Cabinet and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation in shaping the future of our Singapore."" How Singapore copes with these democratic demands will be key to its success in its second half-century, but those demands are unlikely to detract from Lee's achievements in its first 50 years.  In 2010, Time magazine listed Lee as one of world's 100 most influential people. ""The mark of a great leader is to take his society from where it is to where it has never been,"" wrote former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the article on Lee. ""There is no better strategic thinker in the world today.""","Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister in 1959 .

Christine Hà, an American chef, writer and blogger from Houston, Texas, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up with a tried-and-tested formula. Christine Hà, who lost her sight in 2007, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up without a mirror . Christine, 35, who has a video series on YouTube called 'Blind Life of Christine Ha', explains that she decided to release a beauty tutorial after a lot of people asked her how a visually impaired person does their own make-up. The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said: 'I remember back when I was filming Masterchef we had to do our own hair and make-up. 'I would sit and put on my own make-up and a lot of my friends on the show would watch me in awe because I don't use a mirror.' The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said her fellow contestants would watch her doing her make-up in awe because she didn't use a mirror .

Christine, who suffers from neuromyelitis optica, whereby her immune system attacked the optic nerves and spinal cord, explains that she will demonstrate her daily wear make-up. 'The first thing is foundation,' she begins. 'Now I am in my 30s, I've been told we have to worry more about redness on our skin so I have started wearing it. Brush it all on, which helps it blend really well so I don't have to worry too much about streaks. 'As you can see, I am covering the area around my nose where I get the most redness, or so I've been told.' She then takes a pair of eyelash curlers and says: 'A lot of people think this is scary because I can't see, but I can feel the eyelash curler so I know that I have it pressed up against my eyelid.' She admits that applying mascara is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand . While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush across the apple of her cheeks . She then takes her mascara, which she says is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand. She explains: 'You approach you lashes very gently and once you feel the brush on your lashes, you know to start stroking it on. I do two layers on both eyes.' While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush. 'I do about five swirls across my face and always tap before I put it on to get rid of excess,' she says. Next, she applies lip liner, which she says she also does  by feel. Lastly, she applies eyeliner. She finally applies lipliner and lipstick, which she says she does by feel . She says: 'Some people may think it's backwards to do your eyeliner last but I want to make sure my mascara is dry because I can't see if it smudges. 'This can be tricky so I anchor my hands against my face so I can have more control of the pencil. I look up and start in the outer corner and draw in a few gentle line strokes. 'I don't like to go all the way into my inner corner because this helps make your eyes look a little bigger.'

The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash.

McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe celebrates sinking Crystal Palace to reach Wembley in 2008 . But he was consoled by Wayne Brown after Bristol City lost the 2008 Championship Play-off final to Hull . Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

9e63922c8f598adeaa632d45d804ca8419609f17,"Great artworks sometimes come in an unexpected form. A Chinese university professor has created a series of vivid portraits of well-known figures using tiny pieces of jeans, reported the People's Daily Online. The largest of all, an image of a Buddha, measures two metres (6.6ft) in height and comprises more than 10,000 pieces of denim. Wang Xiaolei, an associate professor at Wuhan Textile University, started creating what he calls ‘denim paintings’ after visiting a town in China in 2007 which specialised in processing off-cut cloth pieces but had a terrible effect on the surrounding environment in doing so. Creativity: Wang Xiaolei, working on a portrait of Audrey Hepburn, embarked on the unusual endeavour of 'painting' with unwanted denim after witnessing how scrap cloth factories destroy the environment . Variety: Mr Wang's paintings cover a wide range of figures from Chairman Mao to David Beckham (centre) Vividness: The professor's interpretation of Zhang Yimo (left), a famous Chinese film director, and Mo Yan (right), a Nobel Prize-winning Chinese author . His interest was strengthen after an academic visit to the University of Manchester in 2008, during which he learned more ways of recycling scrap cloth. Since then, Mr Wang has collected tens of thousands of old jeans for experimenting with his art. He says denim has a three-dimensional quality so it is easy to make shapes with. To make a portrait, he first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings. Then he goes into a trail-and-error stage of setting out the outlines and establishing the different shades of colours of the particular picture, and this could take more than 100 alterations to get right. Fashion: Mr Wang's unique style has created a trend among his students at Wuhan Textile University who regularly paint with him in the studio. In this picture, he is holding a portrait of Andy Lau, a renowned singer and actor from Hong Kong . Process: The professor first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings, before creating artworks of figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio (left) Effort: To set the correct outlines and colour tones of a painting sometimes takes more than 100 alterations . Mr Wang creates portraits of a range of Chinese and international figures, including Chairman Mao, Fan Bingbing, David Beckham, Michael Jackson, Audrey Hepburn and Leonardo Dicaprio. His wife Taohui, who also collaborates on him with his ‘denim painting’, says Mr Wang is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year’s eve in his studio. Extended periods of concentration on these denim collages, separating the cloth into almost identical shades of colour, has also resulted in his eyes almost always being bloodshot. Mr Wang’s hard work finally paid off when his paintings attracted the attention of a director of the Cultural University of Japan, who invited the denim warrior to hold an exhibition in Japan. He has also produced portraits for the eight invited guest speakers at the World Textile Conference last November. Devotion: Mr Wang's wife says her husband is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year's Eve in his studio .

3d3605febbd6c708b9f5d25882d2facc9726e689,"Obama, pictured on Wednesday, made his first remarks on Ferguson police's racial discrimination . President Obama said the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement. Obama said improving civil rights and civil liberties with police is one of the areas that 'requires collective action and mobilization' 50 years after pivotal civil rights marches brought change to the country. The president made his first remarks about this week's Justice Department report of racial bias in Ferguson, which found officers routinely discriminating against blacks by using excessive force. The Justice Department refused to prosecute Ferguson cop Darren Wilson despite compiling a 350,000-page report on racial profiling in the Missouri city which 'led to' him fatally shooting unarmed black teen Michael Brown on August 9, 2014. 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Obama's interview was to preview his trip Saturday to Selma, Alabama, where he plans to speak from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where white police officers beat civil rights protesters on March 7, 1965. Obama last visited Selma in 2007, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination and spoke about the responsibility of those who came after the civil rights generation of the '60s to carry on the struggle. It was a theme he reiterated ahead of his return visit. In another interview with radio host Tom Joyner, Obama said that despite the progress in race relations over the past 50 years, the Justice Department findings about Ferguson show that civil rights 'is an unfinished project.' 'There is work to be done right now,' he said. On Friday, Obama was kicking off the weekend's 50th anniversary with a town hall meeting at South Carolina's Benedict College, a historically black college. The White House said Obama plans to speak about efforts young people made throughout history to expand opportunity. Obama's visit to Columbia is his first trip to South Carolina as president. Obama has just two other states to reach his goal of traveling to all 50 in office - South Dakota and Utah. Catalyst: The Justice Department began the civil rights investigation following the August shooting of Michael Brown (left), an unarmed black 18-year-old, by white police officer Darren Wilson (right) The Justice Department report of bias in Ferguson that came out this week revealed that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-American (a protester pictured on August 15 last year during a demonstration)","Obama said that there are places where trust between police and the communities they serve has broken down .

64cece9fc20a75f517847eccd2c6a586248a49de,"It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'. But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon. Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.' Scroll down for video . McHipster? Despite running this ad just weeks ago, it's been reported that McDonald's will begin to offer kale on its menu in the near future . Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality. 'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote. However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.' Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer. The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month. February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. Leafy: The trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies, say analysts . Moving on up: Reports of the new McMenu item come just after the company's announced intention Monday to become a more 'modern, progressive burger company' The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month. Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline. Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board. 'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.","A Big Mac ad that debuted in January pasted the words 'will never be kale' over the signature burger's lettuce .

d86727012f39a4b7c69c3c4a4c58b08612a0cc25,"The head of the Catholic church in England today said he was 'dismayed' that immigration is a major concern for voters ahead of the general election. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' without immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution'. David Cameron's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was left in tatters last week when it emerged the figure reached almost 300,000 in the year to September. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' with immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution' Mr Cameron has admitted that his failure to fulfil his pledge has fuelled public concern about the numbers of people moving to the UK. In a letter sent to Catholic churches across the country, the Church's bishops warn: 'There is a great danger of blaming immigrants for the ills of society.' Cardinal Nichols told BBC One's Andrew Marr show that 'every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration'. 'No government in the last three decades has solved the problem of immigration, so it is a really difficult issue.' Asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election, he replied: 'Well I am because I do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us? 'Do we see ourselves genuinely as a player, as a contributor wanting to build something that is better for everybody?' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Mr Cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue . Polling data shows the level of public concern about immigration is higher when the numbers coming to Britain have risen. Cardinal Nichols added: 'What I want to keep saying is these are people we're talking about – the people who drown in the Mediterranean trying to get into Europe, the people who are caged in Calais because they're desperate. 'We have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city, for example, would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who've come to this country. Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach . 'The vast majority of immigrants come here and work hard and make a very positive contribution. That's the tone in which we should be having this debate.' A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months. Of these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on year, after work restrictions were lifted in January 2014. Despite the humiliation of his broken promise, the Prime Minister has vowed to stick to his target of cutting net migration below 100,000. Mr Cameron said last month: 'Back in the 1980s when we had an open economy, we had migration in the tens of thousands, and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country.' He added: 'I believe that we would be a better, stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' Today Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach. The shadow home secretary said her party would focus on illegal immigration and short term student visas in an effort to bring net migration down. Asked whether immigration was too high, Ms Cooper told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'Yes and we have said that before and we would like to see it come down.' Pressed on whether Labour would set a target for net migration, she said: 'He (Mr Cameron) failed in that approach. 'I think that is the wrong approach to take because what he's done is he set a target for net migration, he said no ifs no buts he was going to meet it, and in fact the actual level is three times the target that he set. 'And also a net migration target puts all immigration in together, so it treats students, alongside people coming to work alongside people who are looking for work alongside people who might have come for family reasons, alongside refugees. 'It puts all of those different kinds of immigration together. I think that is the wrong approach.'","Letter to 500,000 parishes warns of blaming immigrants for ills of society .

Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and £7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems. After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor. Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs. And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year. Lisa Blake, 41, gave birth to healthy twin boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 month, in July 2014 . Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.' The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby. Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong. 'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame. 'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum. 'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.' Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive. But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless. Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment. Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew. 'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF. 'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.' Miss Blake (right) had been trying to conceive for six years, and had spent £7,000 on IVF treatment. She was only able to have children when her sister, Julie Wealand, 35, (left), donated her eggs . Miss Blake became pregnant in December 2013, and gave birth to twins Joshua and Harrison in July 2014. She said her sister had given her 'the best gift she could have ever asked for' But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs. Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs. 'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said. 'She promptly replied ""You can use mine"". 'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.' After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling. Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm. A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful. Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked. 'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.' So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try. Miss Blake, pictured with partner Stephen, 37, and her newborn babies, gave birth by Caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia . Miss Blake and her partner said they were 'overjoyed' when they discovered they were having twins, who, eight months later, are thriving . She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood' Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins. She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal. 'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.' At 35 weeks, doctors worried that Lisa was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure, which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy. In order to minimize the risk, doctors delivered the twin babies via Caesarean section. Miss Blake said: 'I was disappointed that I wouldn't have a natural birth, but all I cared about was the boys being healthy. 'Julie wanted to be my side when I gave birth, but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so Stephen clutched my hand instead. 'Without her, we wouldn't have a beautiful family.' Now eight months old, Harrison and Joshua are thriving. Miss Blake said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum and I can't wait to celebrate Mother's Day with the boys. 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood.'","Lisa Blake, 41, and her partner Stephen were desperate to have children .

4b9087acd56acdda56f211339ad0aac8f04b2214,"Jodi Arias was sentenced to life behind bars today after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'. The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty. Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April. Scroll Down for Video . Impassive: Jodi Arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in Phoenix on Thursday morning . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . Agony: Tanisha Sorenson becomes inconsolable after hearing that Jodi Arias has escaped the death penalty . Arias' mother, Sandra, broke down too and received a hug from a friend. It is the second time a jury has failed to decide on life or death for Arias, 34, and under Arizona state law she cannot be tried again - a sore disappointment for the prosecution who have always sought execution. Indeed, it was revealed afterwards that jurors who deadlocked on punishment for convicted murderer Jodi Arias say they were split 11-1 in favor of the death penalty and that they tried unsuccessfully to get the lone dissenter, a woman, kicked off the panel. Fourteen jurors, including at least one alternate and one woman removed from the panel earlier, talked to reporters Thursday after the verdict. None of them would reveal their names. Many of the jurors said Arias lacked remorse and some said she tried to manipulate them. Jurors also said they believed the holdout was biased and that the woman even had an agenda. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Realization: Sorenson raises her hand to her face as she breaks down in tears after Jodi Arias verdict was announced . The Alexander family released a statement to say they are 'saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' 'Obviously, as I said, during the closing arguments, during the opening statements, and several times during the trial, that the events of June 4, 2008 were a tragedy, and the no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness. I don't think today's victory will repair any sadness or change anything but we hope it can begin the closure process for all those who were affected by that tragedy. Thank you,' Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi told reporters Thursday. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis ""Greg"" Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' The controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which Arias was found guilty of in 2013. Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. In closing statements, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi called for Arias' life to be spared, describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood. Prosecutor Juan Martinez accused Arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty. On Tuesday, the jury of eight women and four men were told by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to try harder to come to a decision, after apparently deadlocking. Arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after Stephens denied the defendant's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments. The original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony. Grief stricken:Sorenson cries as she leaves the court house with family and friends on Thursday in Phoenix . Tears for her brother: Family members of victim Travis Alexander wept when the judge said jurors couldn't reach a decision. They sobbed as they left the courtroom . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the Jodi Arias sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation.","Judge Sherry Stephens was told of impasse on Thursday morning .

The pair became embroiled in a heated argument at half-time during the champions’ 2-1 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month. Both were omitted from the starting XI for the following match against Leicester. But City say the row had nothing to do with Manuel Pellegrini’s selection and the warring duo could be back in the line-up for Saturday’s match at Turf Moor.

Kompany was dropped to the bench when Manchester City hosted Leicester City last week . Kompany attempts to tackle Raheem Sterling during City's 2-1 defeat by Liverpool three days earlier . Tempers flared at Anfield when City returned to the dressing room with the score 1-1. In the build-up to Liverpool’s opener, midfielder Fernandinho sold defender Kompany  short with a poor pass before Jordan Henderson scored. ‘Fernandinho had a go at Vinnie and he went right back at him,’ a City insider told Sportsmail. ‘He was raging. Others had to get involved to stop it.’ According to reports, Pellegrini sided with the Brazilian, which prompted more fury from Kompany before team-mates stepped in. City declined to comment on the incident, but strongly deny it influenced Pellegrini’s decision to rest Fernandinho and bench Kompany for the 2-0 win over Leicester. Fernandinho started the game against Liverpool but was dropped out of the squad for the next game . City captain Kompany trains before his side's Premier League clash with Leicester . Kompany, who signed a new five-year contract last summer following a 2008 move from Hamburg, was an unused substitute for the following match, a 2-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Leicester City, with Pellegrini claiming he needed to freshen his side up. Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether. Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country. They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game.

John Derick Sandham, 31, was at his reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, when he launched an attack on a group of young friends also having a drink at the venue. The court heard how Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier, head-butted one victim before hitting him in the face with a glass or a bottle. John Derick Sandham, 31 (pictured left with wife Clare and right) has been jailed for three years after sparking a brawl at his wedding reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, in August 2013 . Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier (pictured), launched the attack on three teeangers, head-butting one victim before hitting another in the face with a glass or a bottle . He then grabbed another of the teenagers by the throat, before hitting the third victim on the back of the head, Mold Crown Court was told. It came after he told the trio that he could 'knock them out with one punch'. Sandham had claimed he was acting in self-defence, telling the court: 'This was my wedding night. It is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was blighted by this.' But he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term. Sentencing Sandham, Judge Philip Hughes said: 'It was drunken violence against youths who had done nothing to warrant your aggression against them.' The court heard how the brawl broke out in August 2013 while 100 friends and family were marking the marriage at the Abbott's Arms in Holywell, North Wales. The defendant (pictured left and right) had claimed self-defence but he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term . The victims, who were aged 16 and 17, were not part of the wedding party. The court heard how the incident took place when Sandham went outside at the end of the night to say 'goodbye' to his guests. The defendant walked through the porch, where he was said to have asked the friends - who were 'having a laugh and messing about' - what they were saying. He then walked straight up to the group and grabbed one of them, before launching the furious attacks, the court heard. The brawl unfolded in the porch at the Abbot's Arms in Holywell, Flintshire (pictured), the court heard .

aa8860df154872936a867c8c7504fbedc2078f07,"Children are suffering damage to their hearts as early as 12 due to poor diets, a study has warned. Researchers found most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly through unhealthy eating habits. The American study showed few children under the age of 12 had an ideal diet and almost a third (30 per cent) were overweight or even obese. The researchers said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices, the healthier their hearts will be in adulthood. Study senior author Doctor Donald Lloyd-Jones, professor and chair of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said: ‘Our findings indicate that, in general, children start with pretty good blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Scientists said the better equipped children are to make healthy food choices, the healthier their hearts would be in adulthood. They said few children under the age of 12 taking part had an ideal diet, and almost a third were overweight or even obese (file picture posed by model) ‘But if they have a horrible diet, it will drive a worsening body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol levels. ‘The better we can equip our children to make healthy choices, the more cardiovascular health will be preserved into adulthood. ‘And those who preserve their heart health into middle age live much longer and are much healthier while they live.’ Researchers examined BMI, healthy diet, total cholesterol and blood pressure – four of the seven components of heart health – in children aged two to 11. In the sample of 8,961 children, the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure, but none had all four. An ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator, with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet. The experts warned people are losing a lot of 'intrinsic' heart health very early in life, setting them up to be unhealthy adults . The five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of sugar-sweetened drinks and salt, and high intake of wholegrains, fish, plus fruit and vegetables. Fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish, and wholegrains were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target. Ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended, and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from sugar-sweetened drinks. Around four out of ten of the children had ‘poor’ or ‘intermediate’ cholesterol levels, according to the findings published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health, ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups. Previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health, starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood. Dr Lloyd-Jones added: ‘We really need better surveillance data, especially in children. ‘Information on physical activity, blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke are not available for younger children. ‘Without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing, and therefore how many calories are needed, we can’t scale the diet metrics to a child’s needs. ‘So we used the adult metrics, but understand that it would be difficult for a five-year-old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult. ‘The bottom line is that we need even better data, but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life, which sets us up to be unhealthy adults.’","Most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly .

f6df60905f257355d35a74b57da1db14cc225cb3,"Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney poked fun at Barack Obama's penchant for golf, Hillary Clinton's emails and even discussed One Direction on the Tonight Show. In the interview with Jimmy Fallon, Romney talked to his 'reflection' in the mirror and cracked jokes at the President's expense and at his own failed attempt to reach the White House. Earlier this year Romney declared he would not be running for the presidency again, which gave him free rein in the interview. Scroll down for video . In the interview with Jimmy Fallon on Tonight Show, Mitt Romney made jokes at President Obama's expense . In the 'Mitt in the Mirror' sketch, Romney pretended to talk to himself in the mirror with host Jimmy Fallon . Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf as President - a point Romney joked about in the interview . Referring to his upcoming charity boxing bout against Evander Holyfield, Romney quipped: 'I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy' Fallon, pretending to be Romney in the mirror, opened up by asking the real Romney whether he was ready for the big interview. 'Well, actually I'm a little nervous,' Romney admitted. 'Jimmy is probably going to ask me why I didn't run for president. What should I say?' 'Just tell him you enjoy the freedom. You get to sit back, relax, golf all the time, go on vacation whenever you want,' Fallon said as Romney's reflection. 'Aka, be president?' Romney quipped. Obama - who was derided by basketball ace Michael Jordan as a 'hack' on the course - has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he entered the White House. Romney joked about Zayn leaving One Direction saying it was one of the 'important issues facing this nation' Romney made light of the numerous rounds of golf Obama has played since he entered the White House . Romney then went on to discuss his upcoming bout with former heavyweight boxing champion, Evander 'the Real Deal' Holyfield. Romney's reflection wanted some assurance they were not crazy for taking to the ring with the four-time heavyweight champion. The real Romney replied: 'It's all in good fun. It's for charity, what's the worse that can happen?' His reflection joked: 'That's true, I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy'. Romney will be squaring off against Holyfield - who famously had part of his ear bitten off by 'Iron' Mike Tyson in 1997 - for Charity Vision's 'Fight Night' in Salt Lake City on May 15. The pair clearly enjoyed the sketch, which mocked Hillary Clinton's emails and Obama's love of golf . Romney then delved into the world of showbiz to discuss Zayn Malik's departure from boy band One Direction. He said: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction. Thanks Obama.' Moving back to more familiar ground, the real Romney interrupted saying: 'I've got an email here. Hold on, let me take a look.' Fallon, as Romney's reflection, asked: 'Is it work or personal?' To this, Romney quipped: 'Well, the email is from Hillary Clinton, so I guess it's both.' This joke comes in the wake of revelations that Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013. The correspondence of federal officials is considered government records under federal law. While there are exceptions for classified materials, most documents are kept for the use of journalists, congressional committees and historians. Following the controversy, Mrs Clinton said she had simply used private emails out of 'convenience' during her time as Secretary of State. In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 handed over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and now wanted them made public. Romney joked about Mrs Clinton's emails - she did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013 . Referring to Zayn's split from One Direction, Romney remarked: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction' Romney, a former Governor of Massachusetts, was defeated by Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In January, he revealed he would not be running for the presidency again. Mr Romney, 68, said he had decided it was 'best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee'. This week, Ted Cruz, the firebrand Texas senator, became the first Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the race before a crowd of thousands at Liberty University in Virginia.","Romney, who will not run for presidency, joked about Obama's love of golf .

But the pair were silenced by brave Mrs Jones's five-second warning - and fled the post office at Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales. Cool Mrs Jones even served another customer at the shop in Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales, before calling the police. Police arrested Price at his home and found a blue imitation gun along with a balaclava and a paint balling mask used in the February raid. Recorder Judge Eleri Rees praised Mrs Jones for her bravery at Cardiff Crown Court after the pair admitted their crimes. She said: 'To her credit she showed great resilience she stood her ground and then called the police. You were armed with an imitation firearm- she had no idea if it was a real firearm or not. Speaking after the sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, Mrs Jones's son Simon, 48, said: 'She was resilient on that day but then went downhill. She has picked up now and is back working.' 'We have a 72-year-old lady who had worked at that post office for many years. Price, of Machen, near Caerphilly, was sentenced to a total of three and a half years imprisonment. Homeless Andrews was sentenced to a total of four years and eight months imprisonment. The judge lifted reporting restrictions that had previously banned the identification of Price because of his age.

But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way. Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys. The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris . The American video maker captures a shot of the Eiffel Tower in the distance of his unique film . Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris. He said: ‘When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film. ‘We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.’ Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before. Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets . The people captured underneath the Eiffel Tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines . He said: ‘My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.’ The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together. The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines. Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images . A train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child . Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography . A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge. More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football. As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell. Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris . The Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups shots of people looking like toys . A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets. Eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons, a boat travelling under a bridge – which ties Paris’ beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together – and a casual shot of the Eiffel Tower. Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation. Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it . Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality . ‘It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the ""texture"" of the image,’ he said. ‘I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect. This was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening.’ Sean’s work is available on his Facebook page and the original video can be viewed here.","Sean Collins, from LA, created the three-minute footage over eight days .

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six. Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash. Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament. Aussie bowler Trevor Chappell, right, bowls underarm to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie on the last ball of a one-day international from which New Zealand needed to hit six runs to force a tie . Trevor Chappell bowls under-arm, as ordered by brother Greg at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1981 . But Black Caps fast bowler Tim Southee, who was two-years-old at the time of the underarm incident, said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned. 'I guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened,' Southee said at a conference on Friday. 'I haven’t heard too much about the underarm.' While New Zealand prepares ahead of their first ever World Cup final on Sunday, Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his retirement from one-day cricket on the eve of the match. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years.","The notorious underarm incident triggered a massive uproar in 1981 .

0b00c7c4c20e7049d731d0123945387add6e51dd,"Tax hikes in the last five years have raised an extra £16.4billion a year, equivalent of around £255 for every person in the UK. A new study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion. The figures come ahead of George Osborne's final Budget before the election, with Labour warning they lay bare the full extent of the government's failure to fix the economy. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today, is expected to use his Budget on Wednesday to announce a nother increase in the personal tax allowance . Tax rises introduced since 2010 include a £14 billion hike in VAT and a £5.2 billion increase in National Insurance contributions. At the same time the tax reductions of 48 billion include £8 billion from raising the personal threshold for income tax, £5.9 billion in cuts to corporation tax and £3.9 billion from real-terms reductions in fuel duties. However, the IFS said the changes were a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', because they had been introduced in a piecemeal way with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have exacerbated 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, said the IFS. It was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting ever-more lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched, and it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes had not been integrated. Mr Osborne is expected to use Wednesday's Budget to announce another big rise in the personal tax allowance. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said: ‘The main thing the government can do is just take less of your money away from you. ‘I very much want to give the biggest possible Workers’ Bonus to millions of people on middle and low incomes.' The  study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion . The IFS highlighted the 'problematic' failure to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, and warned of a 'rapid' increase in workers paying higher rates of income tax as the economy improves. Unless the phenomenon known as 'fiscal drag' is dealt with, the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will double within a decade, the report predicted. The report also warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on property prices in 1991. And it said that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had 'seen a stream of ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each other without a clear statement of principles or long-run intentions'. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked . Authors Stuart Adam and Barra Roantree said: 'There is a better way to make tax policy. The corporate tax road map was a good start, setting out a direction of travel and providing an element of predictability. The next government would be well advised to apply this approach to more elements of the tax system, and indeed to the tax system as a whole. 'That would help taxpayers to plan, provide a benchmark for assessing the policies actually implemented, and facilitate debate on whether the strategy laid out is the right one. Taking the time to articulate a strategy might even lead to the adoption of better tax policy.' Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Standard: 'The old Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked. And once again, a Tory Chancellor is giving with one hand but taking away much more with the other. 'No pre-election tax cut can mask the £1,127 a year which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says families have lost because of tax and benefit changes since 2010 — from higher VAT to cuts to tax credits.'","By 2015-16 coalition will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion .

de6c89a6df60591148429a916d50983de1f42714,"(CNN)Chelsea's good week continued when the Blues beat West Ham 1-0 in the English Premier League to maintain a five-point lead over Manchester City atop the table. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho -- who picked up another trophy Sunday in the League Cup final -- had never lost to West Ham in the top flight and Belgian attacker Eden Hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half Wednesday at the Hammers' Upton Park. ""The game was very difficult,"" Hazard told Sky. ""One big battle against a good team with very good players. ""It's always difficult when you don't score the second goal to kill the game. But one goal was enough. It's not always like this. ""The goalkeeper, the defense we have are very strong. It was very good."" Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but West Ham boss Sam Allardyce lamented his team's finishing -- plus the refereeing. He felt Hazard's goal was offside. ""When you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out, that's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard,"" the under pressure Allardyce told Sky. Nigel Pearson, manager of last-place Leicester, also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2-0 to reigning league champion Manchester City. Leicester didn't get a penalty when City striker Wilfried Bony appeared to foul Jeff Schlupp in the  box in the first half or when Fernando fouled Andrej Kramaric in the second. Leicester struck the woodwork, too. City -- reeling following back-to-back defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool -- only really came to life after David Silva's opener in first-half stoppage time. Leicester's veteran keeper Mark Schwarzer thwarted City to keep it close but could do little on James Milner's 88th-minute effort. The win was ""very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against Liverpool and Barcelona,"" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who rested club captain Vincent Kompany. Elsewhere, four teams vying for Champions League spots all won. Manchester United claimed all three points at Newcastle when Ashley Young took advantage of keeper Tim Krul's error in the 89th minute; Arsenal doubled third-last QPR 2-1; surging Liverpool shut out second-last Burnley 2-0; and League Cup finalist Tottenham defeated Swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsing to the turf. United defender Jonny Evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at St. James' Park, since he appeared to spit in striker Papiss Cisse's direction when they clashed in the first half. Cisse then appeared to spit back at Evans. Arsenal remained third, with United in fourth on 53 points, two better than Liverpool, four better than Southampton and six better than Spurs, who have a game in hand. In Wednesday's other match, Stoke extended Everton's league slide by blanking the Toffees 2-0 at home. Barcelona reaches Copa del Rey final . In Spain, meanwhile, Barcelona reached the Copa del Rey final by easing past Villarreal 6-2 on aggregate. Holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg, Barcelona won away by the same score Wednesday, helped by Neymar's double. Barcelona faces familiar foe Athletic Bilbao in May's finale.

f5cda2fb1455a37af718d9f85f038d5dd136697a,"(CNN)As a well-traveled photographer, Pieter ten Hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps. But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there. His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound. ""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said. With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available. The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken. One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered. ""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said. The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees. The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos. Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely. ""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."" The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well. ""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said. He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."" Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength. Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera. Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography. ""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."" How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear? ""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun. ""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.""

In a statement on the church website, Bishop David Kendall said the Reverend Phyllis Sortor was released Friday evening, Nigeria time, 'into the care of authorities and Free Methodist Church leaders'. Armed men abducted her on February 23 from the Hope Academy compound in Emiworo, Kogi state. Scroll down for video . Phyllis Sortor, 71, was abducted on February 23 from a Christian school in Nigeria. She was released on Friday and is safe . Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Sortor hostage . 'We are deeply grateful to all who prayed for Phyllis' safe return and praise God the family representative was able to secure her release,' Kendall said in his statement. He provided no details about how the release was arranged. 'As a matter of sound policy, and to help protect the many, many people who helped secure Phyllis' freedom, we will have no comment concerning the efforts that were undertaken to secure her release,' the bishop said. Kogi State police said shortly after the abduction that the men who took Sortor had demanded a ransom of nearly $300,000. Police said they were collaborating with security forces to secure her return. Friends described Sortor as courageous, tenacious and passionate about helping the people of Nigeria and said she was aware of the dangers. Sortor has been working as a missionary  for ten years. Her friends say she was passionate about helping people in Nigeria and aware of the dangers of working there . She had spent years living in Africa, including Mozambique - where she spent much of her childhood - later working in Rwanda and, since 2005, Nigeria, Kendall said . Her work in Kogi was focused primarily on educational development and conflict resolution between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities who frequently clash in central Nigeria's Middle Belt region, the church statement further said. Foreign nationals have often been kidnapped in Nigeria by local gangs who typically release hostages following a ransom payment. Such abductions are especially common in the southern, oil-producing Niger Delta, where expatriates working with large oil companies have been a frequent target. A number of foreigners have also been kidnapped in the north of the country, but those attacks claimed by Boko Haram or the associated Islamist group Ansaru are considered a different phenomenon, and not necessarily motivated by a desire for ransom. Boko Haram has been blamed for previous attacks in Kogi, including two raids targeting the same prison in 2012 and 2014. Nigeria's Islamists groups have in the past publicly claimed the abduction of expatriates and the lack of such a claim following Sortor's kidnapping led many to believe that Boko Haram and its affiliates were not involved.","Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Phyllis Sortor hostage on February 23 .

Posing on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson, Nick Sayer soaks up the winter sun outside his holiday home in Florida. It is one of several shots of motorbikes, supercars and lavish holidays he has posted online in recent years…to the delight of his friends. For while pensioners are targeted every day by cold callers, the man who sold their personal data is apparently relishing the spoils. B2C director Sayer – who is nicknamed Del Boy – is among a group of bosses at the firm who have got rich quick by selling people’s most personal information. The 45-year-old father-of-two says he carries out his business from a ‘man cave’ in the garden of his home in Kent. He began his working life as a diver on oil rigs in Azerbaijan, before, he claims, he was set up in business by a Greek shipping billionaire. They ran a commercial diving company before he decided to make money for himself by selling personal data with a series of companies, most of which have been dissolved or liquidated. ‘For years I was called “oh, you’re just a Del Boy”,’ he said. ‘I work from home, I’ve got a little log cabin thing out in me garden, that’s where I kind of base me-self. ‘I don’t like being in the house, I just go out there. It’s a bit of a man cave really.’ While his garden office may be modest, Sayer’s other tastes are much more ostentatious. His Facebook page shows off images of nine sports cars as well as pictures of him skiing in Banff, Canada. Scroll down for video . The British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car which he pictures on a drive on his profile costs up to £50,000 and boasts a top speed of 180mph. The Harley-Davidson Road King motorbike he is seen on in one image costs £17,595 new. Sayer regularly holidays with his family at his villa in Kissimmee, Florida, which they rent out for £600 a week. The home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms, all ‘fitted with luxury furnishings’.

Luxury: Sayer's Flordia home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms . The fake cash fraudster . Also trading in people’s personal information for B2C is convicted fraudster Gary Doran, 36, who wanted the Mail’s undercover team to pay Sayer off the books. The Mancunian, who now lives in Marbella, was jailed for six months for fraud in 2004 for trying to use two fake £10 notes to buy vodka. A 23-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University at the time, he tried to buy drink with the fake money at the Queen of Hearts pub in Fallowfield. The barmaid rejected the notes and the police were called, later finding him with 15 other fake bank notes. After serving time in jail, he has since run several failing businesses with his father and brother from their family home in Manchester. Most recently, as sales director of B2C Data, he asked an undercover reporter from the Mail to buy data off the books as a ‘favour to a friend’. He wanted the money to be paid directly into Sayer’s personal account, as a way of avoiding tax. Sporting life: The 180mph British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car on the Sayer's Facebook page . Jet-setting boss who said he knew nothing . B2C owner Stephen Hogg insists his firm ‘do everything completely, totally and utterly by the book’. The jet-setting golfer was, however, completely oblivious to his staff offering to sell data tax free through their own accounts. He even had no idea Doran had previously served time for fraud. The 46-year-old lives with his wife Sarah, 43, and their children in a £400,000 five-bedroom house in Rushden, Northamptonshire. Last week, there were three cars on the driveway outside the large home in a secluded cul-de-sac. Hogg appears to have spent much of the past month playing golf at clubs across Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He and his wife also go online to boast of their holidays to Portugal and Australia. ‘Holidays, bar, golf and no diet!, he wrote during one of his travels. The couple, who have two children, started B2C Data just three months after his previous data company Unique Prospects was dissolved. He said he has also shut another firm down in the past after ‘certain allegations’, before insisting ‘that wasn’t my company by the way’. When approached by the Mail about B2C’s activities, Hogg said: ‘We are a member of the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office], and DMA [Direct Marketing Association]. We do everything correctly.’ When told his employees had offered to sell his company’s data off the books and that Doran is a convicted fraudster, he added: ‘You’ve just made me aware of two things that I need to go and talk to people about.’ He described B2C Data as ‘a legitimate business’ working within the law. Cold callers use a wide range of tricks to obtain people's personal data (picture posed by model) Will writing: Pensioners are often targeted by callers who offer will writing advice on the cheap. This is often a ploy to gain your trust and access as many personal details – including about your finances – as possible. The firms then try to sell high risk investments as ‘add-ons’. Charity surveys: A homeowner is called and asked to complete a survey for charity. They are told if they answer a certain number of questions, a pre-selected charity will be paid £10 or so – so many kind-hearted people naturally agree. However, all the answers are collated and sold on. ‘Validating’ your details: Marketing firms will call customers of a major brand and claim they need to ‘validate’ the details they hold. After asking the customer to confirm their name, address and phone number, however, many will go on to try to get you to complete a ‘lifestyle survey’. These questions are, in fact, sponsored by various other companies and details are sold on. Soft questions: Watch out for surveys starting with ‘easy’ questions. One firm admitted it starts surveys with questions anyone would answer – like do you have a television? Only later do the questions become more intrusive – about your earnings and the worth of your home. Computer updates: Scammers try to hack into PCs by pretending to be from Microsoft. Following their ‘updating’ instructions can allow them to take control of the computer remotely and capture personal data. No call lists: The telephone preference list, which should block cold callers, is a free service. Some firms will, however, try to charge you as much as £1.60 a month. Shares: With your financial details on file, some cold calling firms are able to see which companies you have shares in. As a result, scammers can pretend to be calling from the companies you have invested in and try to convince the homeowner to pass on more financial details. Prizes: Once they have your details, scammers are able to send you misleading letters saying you have won large cash prizes. There are often hidden costs in claiming this supposed prize, like making you call premium rate phone numbers.","Nick Sayer got rich quick selling people's most personal information .

Pietersen, who is being loaned to TMS for radio stints by his World Cup employers Fox Sports, will work alongside Swann for the first time at the Auckland semi-final a week on Tuesday. And the powderkeg confrontation between the ex-England team-mates, whose relationship disintegrated in the fall-out from the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash, has been given spice with the possibility KP might now return to county cricket and the national team. Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen, once happy team-mates, are not longer on such good terms . Swann and Pietersen are to help commentate on Test Mach Special for the World Cup semi-finals next week . Swann has accused KP of ‘upsetting people wherever he goes’, says the ECB were ‘justified’ in terminating his England contract and calls Pietersen’s autobiography a ‘work of fiction’.

Fidel Castro’s Communist Cuba is an unlikely ally of the MCC in their battle to repel property developers Rifkind Levy Partnership.

The MCC have further kept RLP at bay by buying another well-placed house on the same street.

004ac9f58a280ff31f384ada19fe7434fd5628f7,"Boasting nothing more than an empty, concrete shell on the top level, the 'Aurora' Soul penthouse has sold for $7 million to property tycoon, Tony Fung. The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction . However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' The auction that saw Tony Fung one more Australian property richer, took place on March 7. Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood .

The monarch and Duke then met trustees, supporters and volunteers before meeting local school children learning about the Battle of Britain in the dedicated education area, The Geoffrey Page Centre. The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit Café', where they met a group of 'The Few', surviving RAF airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, before viewing a flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon. As part of her duties, the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the opening and received a posy. In the 1980s, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page, a Hurricane pilot who was shot down during the Battle of Britain, realised that there was no national memorial to the men he had with flown with in 1940. His efforts to amend this led to the founding of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust and the unveiling of the National Memorial to the Few – a lone pilot looking out over the English Channel, in the village between Folkestone and Dover – by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

f37982c97d0ac9a2a4a1d76562f304a19fe433f2,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces now have control of Tikrit Military Hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from ISIS. The joint forces raised the Iraqi flag from the hospital premises Wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides, the Hashd Al-Shaabi paramilitary force said. The predominantly Shia militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit from ISIS. The hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, Iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that the consensus was that Iran's involvement was positive in military terms. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" he said. But at the same time, Dempsey said, the United States is concerned about what role Iran might seek in the longer term once ISIS is defeated. While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province. ISIS launched a new offensive on the city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, said in a statement. The city is being attacked ""from all directions,"" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it, he said. Some 17 explosives-laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center, he said. One vehicle targeted a bridge that provides access to the city from the north. This is ""the fiercest attack by ISIS"" seen on Ramadi, al-Issawi said. Iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city. Al-Issawi said the Iraqi air force was urgently needed. ""We need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the Iraqi air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target,"" he said. Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north,"" he added. He said there had been 10 casualties among Iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured. In the 24 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday morning, there were 13 airstrikes in Iraq and two in Syria, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said in a statement. The strikes in Iraq were concentrated near Mosul, Al Qaim and Falluja. There were none in the Tikrit or Ramadi areas. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council. Al-Karhout, speaking to CNN by telephone, said 80% of Karma, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Falluja, was now under the control of Iraqi security forces after a large-scale operation that started Tuesday at dawn. Dozens of ISIS militants were killed in clashes with Iraqi soldiers, he said. The second phase of the operation is to clear any remnants of the ISIS force from the town and to remove any mines and bombs left behind. Iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with Shia Hashd Al-Shaabi units and local tribesmen, Al-Karhout said. Health officials in Falluja told CNN that the Falluja general hospital received the bodies of 25 ISIS militants killed in the Karma battle. ISIS is also battling in many places far from Tikrit, including Syria, where the militant group is more on the offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based nongovernmental organization. ""Hundreds of ISIS militants launched a large scale offensive on Ras al Ayn, a Syrian strategic border town with Turkey on Friday,"" SOHR said in a statement Wednesday. ""They made some advances there and seized Tal Khanzir."" Clashes are still ongoing between the Kurdish People's Protection Units (Kurdish YPG) and ISIS fighters, with dozens killed from both sides, SOHR said. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Baghdad, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Huge corporations are among those being given grants worth hundreds of thousands of pounds while the NHS faces a growing burden from illnesses linked to weight gain. One firm was given almost £500,000 to help improve its chocolate while others were handed large sums to make biscuits or sell ice cream. Taxpayers' money is being handed to fast-food firms such as  PepsiCo as the UK fails to tackle its ongoing obesity crisis . The revelations, contained in a study led by the UK Coronary Prevention Group, has sparked fresh claims that the Government is too close to food firms and is doing ‘too little’ to tackle the £47billion annual cost of obesity. The charity said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies. Its report identified a string of occasions when public cash was given to firms who make millions marketing junk food for projects that undermine public health. £86,472 from public funds to help companies make confectionery wafer biscuits. £31,000 government grant to help a farmer convert a barn into an ice cream shop. £637,812 handout to help a company improve its chocolate blending equipment. £24,750 to develop 3-D chocolate printing for personalised gifts. 0%VAT charged on unhealthy cake mix, drinking chocolate and salt – compared with 20 per cent levied on mineral water and healthy snacks such as roast almonds and dried fruit. It found the Government’s Technology Strategy Board gave £637,812 to a joint project with Mondelez – the parent company of Cadbury – for ‘confectionary production’. Another grant of £487,268 was given to Nestec, part of Nestle, to research ‘chocolate cooling technology’. The board also put £356,076 into a joint project with PepsiCo to research dehydrated snacks. Meanwhile, the Rural Development Programme for England gave two grants in 2010 – £12,500 towards biscuit production and £11,400 to help convert a barn into a chocolate-making unit. The year before, the quango handed over £143,000 to convert a farm building for ice cream production. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council put £100,173 into a project designed to improve the ‘sensory properties’ of confectionary wafers. Some £180,000 went on two other projects involving wafers. The UK Coronary Prevention Group says the Government has ‘failed’ on obesity and ‘done too little’ to tackle dietary habits. UK Coronary Prevention Group said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies . Professor Philip James, chairman of the charity’s trustees, said: ‘Some of these grants are greater than the amounts spent by local health services tackling overweight in adults and children.’ The group has now identified 200 measures including a ban on fast-food outlets near schools and business-rate cuts for alternatives offering healthy dishes. Supermarkets would also be required to offer price promotions on healthy food, while there would be strict controls on all food sold in schools and hospitals. The report comes after it emerged last month that the Government’s anti-obesity drive was being overseen by a firm that also helps promote fast food. PR business Freud Communications earns £3million a year to run crucial public-health campaigns – including Change4Life – while also working with companies including Mars, KFC, PepsiCo and Walkers crisps. Experts claim that thousands by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks . Researchers have claimed that rather than giving taxpayer funds to fast food firms, the government should be putting up the price of full sugar drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Experts at the University of Liverpool and the Children’s Food Campaign claim that thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided, saving the NHS £300million, by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks. The academics' work will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food. Health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the ‘new tobacco’. The Liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre – 12p per can – would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years. They estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer. These figures relate to England alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of £300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years, releasing money for other patients.","A study found thousands of pounds were being given to junk food firms .

88e78b62e31032bef10635fe9d14f92b27a1066c,"Melissa Brittle, 38, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for failing to report the abuse of her grandson . A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs. Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license. 'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said. Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother . 'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him. Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended. Robert Dean Watkins was the step-grandson of Raymond Brittle. Raymond and Melissa has agreed to take care of the child for his mother . Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him. An autopsy found that most of the boy's body was covered with bruises. He also had a fracture that covered three quarter of his skull and the injuries caused his brain to shift.","Melissa Brittle was sentenced under Maryland law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse .

1a4bc7066a73d224b99c3775406d3eb6d30135e1,"An 85-year-old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year. Albert Clemens Senior’s home first became a target in March 2014, and the attacks have yet to stop, confounding neighbors, local government officials and even the police in Euclid, Ohio. Despite there being no let-up in the egg onslaught, no one has been able to identify the culprits. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago. Clemens’ wife has passed away, but he continues to live in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter. ‘The accuracy is phenomenal, because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door,’ says Clemens. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home . The frequency is troubling too, as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week, occasionally more than once a day. The egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes. The latest an attack has come is 2 a.m., and the noise as an egg hits the front door or aluminium siding of the house has been compared to the crack of a gunshot. Al Clemens Jr told Fox8 Cleveland that eggs are about 80 per cent of the items thrown at his home. There have also been apples, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits and canned goods. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. Albert Clemens Sr, 85, lives in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter . The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis-aimed eggs, few hit neighboring homes. ‘Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,’ Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser told Cleveland.com. Local police are not taking the investigation lightly, trying undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighbourhood, installing surveillance cameras, and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing. At one point the entire community policing unit was on the case. Luckily for police the home is less than a mile from the police station and officers are able to respond quickly to each attack. The finger has been pointed at a couple suspects in the neighborhood over the course of the year since the attacks began. Clemens was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood – suspected drug activity. Another nieghbor was suspected, but police saw him standing outside during an attack. The eggs have been traced back to a nearby Amish farm, but that yielded no further clues. Fingerprinting the eggs turned up nothing and the protein in eggs destroys any DNA evidence. Other lines of inquiry have suggested that the culprits are taking bad eggs from businesses that throw them away. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago . The attacks have been so frequent that Clemens has been unable to keep up with the clean up . Officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs. Neighbors have been questioned and fliers have been handed out, but nothing has turned up any leads. ‘The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,’ Houser said. ‘I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.’ Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. Indeed police involvement seems to do nothing to deter the perpetrators. An officer was hit on the foot by an egg while he was at the house when an attack was launched. ""The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,"" Houser said. A reward of $500 was offered, and that was then upped to $1,000, but still no one came forward. If caught, the culprit will be charged with felony vandalism and criminal damage, and officers are not ruling out hate crime charges if there is evidence. Clemens (pictured) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving: ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare’ Clemens used to clean up after each attack but hasn’t been able to keep up. Worse, his insurance company will not settle any claim until the attackers are stopped, so no repairs can be made. The harsh winter has offered some respite for the family, as the egg attacks became less frequent. However once warmer weather comes, both Clemens and Euclid police expect the eggings to start again. Clemens is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs. ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid.

bfebdda62b268586be9c75b1731348406a9a9187,"(CNN)The U.S. Navy doesn't just do stuff ""for fun,"" says the command master chief of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, but what 30% of the ship's crew will be up to over the next year or so can at least be termed pretty cool. And it will certainly be unprecedented. Some 1,200 of the Reagan's crew will be executing what the Navy calls a three-hull swap, serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements. The 1,200 are calling themselves ""The Three Presidents Crew,"" as they will serve aboard three of the Navy's carriers named after presidents: the Reagan, the USS George Washington and the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The crew will even have its own insignia and hull number, CVN 220, the sum of the hull numbers of the Reagan (CVN 76), the Roosevelt (CVN 71) and the Washington (CVN 73). Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class David Frederick aboard the Reagan came up with the logo. ""I am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this 'Three Presidents' crew, and I hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the Sailors who are involved in this crew swap,"" he said. The swap will begin this summer. The George Washington will go from its home port in Japan to San Diego, where a crew swap with the Reagan will take place. While the George Washington crew takes the Reagan to replace the Washington in Japan, the Three Presidents crew will board the George Washington, which will be headed for Norfolk, Virginia, and an overhaul. The 1,200 will sail with the Washington around South America, then they will fly back to San Diego to crew the Roosevelt, which is taking the Reagan's current spot there. ""Think of how difficult a three-hull carrier swap would be to carry out,"" Capt. Chris Bolt, the commander of the Reagan, said in the ship's publication, The 76er. ""It's never been done before."" ""We are just moving assets around so we can continue to meet mission requirements. That's exactly what this is all about. It's not because the Navy said, 'Let's do this for fun,' "" Spike Call, command master chief of the Reagan, said in The 76er. Seven of the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers are named after presidents. As one commenter on the Reagan's Facebook page said, maybe next time, the Navy could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the USS Mount Rushmore. Hmmm, the Navy does have the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), but there is no carrier for Jefferson. So say we sub in the Reagan and come up with CVN 292.

75c7ee365e053b36d6b65deccc74d5bcd555f41f,"One of Australia's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache, as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court. Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen in Australia, will square off against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers. The ACCC will dispute claims made by the company that the Nurofen Specific Pain Range is specially designed to target different types of pain. The consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients. Scroll down for video . Australia's consumer watchdog is taking Nurofen to court over its advertising claiming its products target  specific types of pain . The products in question are: Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog. 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' Mr Sims said. 'In this case, we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing Nurofen Specific Pain Products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain, when this is not the case.' 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' chairman Rod Sims said. It also flagged the 'significantly' higher cost of Nurofen compared to other products as a concern, with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by Nurofen or another comparable brand. A Nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement, and said pain-specific products made life easier for customers. 'Nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of Australians,' the statement read. 'Nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines. 'Nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type.' The ACCC is seeking declarations, injunctions, an order for the publication of corrective notices, penalties and costs.

f762fc3d2540077faeac60a4ca41990e24c3343b,"An FBI agent who was supposed to be upholding the law was busted on 64 counts in a drug tampering case after he stole heroin from investigations and overdosed in an unmarked police car. Matthew Lowry, 33, a heroin-addicted former special agent in the Washington field office tampered with hundreds of grams of heroin seized during drug investigations in 2013 and 2014. He was investigated by the  Department of Justice after  he was found slumped over and unconscious  in his unmarked FBI vehicle from a heroin overdose on September 29. Car: Matthew Lowry, formerly a special agent with the agency's Washington field office was investigated after he was found unconscious in his unmarked FBI vehicle, pictured, on September 29 after overdosing on heroin . Heroin: Bags of heroin, pictured, were recovered from the FBI agent's vehicle where he kept drugs in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically . According to authorities, Lowry, a married father of one, allegedly took drugs that had been processed as evidence, removed heroin from evidence bags, and then added a cutting agent to account for the missing weight. He used a dietary supplement or a laxative as the cutting agents. Lowry then kept the bags of heroin in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically, according to charging documents filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on Friday. His crimes were fueled by an addiction to prescription painkillers, but his dishonesty botched dozens of cases involving suspected drug traffickers in multiple states. In one case, charges were dropped against 14 defendants suspected to be involved with a large-scale drug-trafficking organization that was the subject of a major FBI investigation in California. The investigation included court-ordered wiretaps, physical surveillance and numerous controlled drug buys, time-consuming and costly investigative techniques. Theft: Documents revealed that Lowry took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations . Attorney: Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison . Additionally, his actions caused federal prosecutors to dismiss charges against at least 28 defendants in drug cases. They also had to notify 150 more that Lowry had participated in investigations targeting them. Attorney Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison. Meanwhile, documents revealed that the former FBI agent took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations. Evidence: Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis . Bonsib said in each of 20 incidents involving evidence tampering, Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis. One of Lowry's doctors had prescribed him powerful pain medications without warning him of how addictive they were, Bonsib said. When his doctor left the practice without notice, Lowry tried to kick the addiction but it was 'overpowering' and the pain from his medical condition was 'unbearable.' Bonsib added: 'Mr Lowry recognizes the importance of taking full responsibility for each of his acts and he also recognizes the need to account to the public for his misconduct.' 'He is devastated by the consequences of his conduct, particularly as it has affected the drug investigations that he, his fellow law enforcement officers, and prosecutors had spent so much time developing and pursing.' 'The fact that his conduct has damaged the ability of some of those investigations to be successfully prosecuted is contrary to everything he trained himself for and believes in,' he said. Bonsib described the night Lowry was found unconscious in his car as a 'turning point.' He immediately  met with prosecutors and investigators to help investigate his conduct. He also sought treatment for his addiction. The case is being prosecuted by federal attorneys in Pennsylvania. Lowry wanted to be a law enforcement officer to follow in the footsteps of his father,  a narcotics investigator for Prince George's Police and assistant chief of Anne Arundel County Police.","Matthew Lowry, 33, a former special agent tampered with FBI drugs cases .

4b038fc766179585a64a1c87a4f103444cb1719c,"The Ministry of Defence was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal. In the last year alone the MoD paid out £13.5million in compensation to civilian staff – which amounts to almost a third of the £45million given to serving soldiers. It means that for every £3,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed £1,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules. While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents. Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received £45million in compensation last year - but another £13.5million was paid to bureaucrats . The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive. Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents. In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner. The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries. Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist. One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor. In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor. A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over. In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal . Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs. All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident. An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel. 'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims. 'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'","In the last year the MoD paid out £13.5m in compensation to civilian staff .

06c202f5d2abb2254fe5afcc70deb5d38ff23535,"The Conservatives will build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder, David Cameron will pledge today. A scheme offering starter homes for sale at 20 per cent below the normal market price is to be doubled in size if the Tories win the election. The estimated discount on a typical £200,000 house would be a hefty £40,000. Scroll down for video . Levels of home ownership have plummeted to the lowest level in 30 years, according to latest figures . The scheme for 100,000 such homes was announced at the Conservative Party conference in September. The Prime Minister now wants to build 200,000 over the next five years. Pledging to produce a Britain ‘where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘There is a particular kind of security that comes with having a home – and that’s what I want to talk about today. Too many people have been denied that security. ‘The young people in their 20s and 30s, still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. The couple who want a child but can’t afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn’t be this way.’ David Cameron will pledge to build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder . The move comes amid concern over falling levels of home ownership and the prospect that future generations may never be able to afford a home of their own. Mr Cameron is also considering a radical idea tabled by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to extend the right to buy to 2.5million tenants in housing association properties. The Tories’ Starter Homes initiative is due to begin today. First-time buyers aged under 40 are eligible to apply and can register their interest at www.starter-home.co.uk. The homes will be built by the private sector and several major developers such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey have signed up to take part. Anyone buying one will have to hang on to it for at least five years before selling it on the open market to prevent speculators using the scheme to make a windfall profit. Ministers are consulting on whether to extend the minimum resale period to 15 years. Labour last night attacked the Tory housing plan after Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps struggled to explain how it would be funded. In an interview with Sky News Mr Shapps initially suggested homebuyers would be offered government-subsidised mortgages, before saying ministers would ‘get together’ with developers and landowners to finalise details. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said the comments suggested the Conservatives’ plans were not credible. ‘The Tories’ housing policies are in chaos,’ she said. ‘Grant Shapps, a former housing minister, couldn’t even explain how the Government would deliver a key election pledge.’ But Tory sources said there was a clear plan to keep prices down by allowing construction in areas where planning permission would not normally be granted for housing. Hundreds of acres of unwanted commercial and industrial land are to be turned over for the scheme, which Mr Cameron has said will help ‘unlock home ownership for a generation’. In some cases, developers will be allowed to build a small number of homes for sale on the open market to subsidise the cost of the new starter homes. Developers will also be spared infrastructure levies which add about £20,000 to the cost of a home on a normal development. Rules allowing homeowners to build conservatories without planning permission are to be extended . Controversial rules that allow homeowners to build big conservatories and extensions without planning permission are to be extended for another five years, the Tories said yesterday. The regulations, which permit extensions of up to 26ft long without authorisation – provided no neighbours object – provoked a major row when they were first announced by the Government in 2013. But Tory sources said they would be retained until at least 2020. Regulations which make it easier for former offices to be converted to homes would also be extended. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said that the move was designed to ensure ‘common sense on home extensions, so families aren’t crushed by expensive red tape’. Councils will also be forced to help find plots for people seeking to build their own homes, as part of a scheme that ministers believe could produce up to 20,000 new homes a year. Ministers say they want to offer new starter homes in both towns and the countryside – and it is possible that some will be built in the Green Belt. The price of homes available in the scheme will be capped at £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital. Mr Cameron will pledge that design standards will not be allowed to slip, saying that people will not be offered ‘rabbit hutches or shoe boxes, but decent, well-built homes with gardens – places to start and raise a family’. But industry sources questioned whether the scheme could be delivered and pointed out that it has been doubled in size before a single home has been built. One senior industry figure described the target for 200,000 cut-price homes over five years as ‘very ambitious’ in the context of the 125,000 or so new houses started in total last year.","David Cameron to announce housing policy in speech in today .

The Hammers head across London looking to kickstart their Premier League campaign, having plummeted down to 10th place after no wins in the last six and back-to-back defeats. Arsenal, meanwhile, have surged back into the top four and are into the FA Cup semi-finals after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday night. Alex Song believes West Ham can kickstart their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday . Despite Arsenal's formidable run of seven consecutive home victories in the Premier League, Song - who played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012, before joining Barcelona - believes the Irons can repeat Monaco's performance after the unfancied French side stunned the Emirates Stadium with a 3-1 Champions League victory last month. 'I know this stadium very well and I know when you play with Arsenal it's very hard, but I think Monaco is how you want to play when you play in the Emirates,' Song told the West Ham website, www.whufc.com. 'The best thing to do is to try to be together, defend together very well and when you have the opportunity to go on the counter attack, you have to do it very well like Monaco did it. Song played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012 before joining Barcelona . 'If you want to go to Emirates and try to play you will not have any chance to win the game there because this stadium is very hard to play in. 'You have to stay together very compact and not give them any room, then take the opportunity on the counter attack. 'If we do this very well like Monaco did, then we can get a good result there.' Song, the 27-year-old on loan from Barcelona until the end of the season, feels the Irons can raise their game against Arsenal. 'We have shown a lot of things this season as a team, especially when we play against teams at the highest level like Manchester City and Liverpool or Tottenham. We've done very well and we need to continue to improve in this way,' said Song, who stayed in London to work on his fitness while the rest of the squad were away at a warm-weather camp in Dubai. The 27-year-old feels West Ham can raise their game against Arsenal in the same way Monaco did . 'We can play better and hopefully this game on Saturday will be a very good test for us. 'It has been a long time since we won a game in the league, so we must try to come back and try to win or get one point there. 'Everything is possible in football and we just need to keep believing and trying hard on the pitch.' Song maintains there can be no room for sentiment against his former club. 'They are one part of my life and, because I went there when I was 17, I always say it is my family,' the former Cameroon international said. 'I know this is a special game for me, but that is football and I have to take all the emotion out and just try to play my game, to play the best football I can to help the team to win.'","West Ham have plummeted down to 10th place in the Premier League table .

But while Aidan Turner was unknown to many prior to his turn as the troubled Ross Poldark in the BBC drama of the same name, the 31-year-old is no stranger to success. Yet although he may look familiar to some, others might find him hard to place - unless you're a fan of fantasy films and supernatural drama that is. Turner plays Ross Poldark who's lost his love, Elizabeth (played by Heida Reed, left) to another man . Irish actor Aidan Turner, who plays dashing Captain Ross Poldark, sets pulses racing on the BBC show . For before donning the tricorn hat and brooding scowl of the landowner who returns to Cornwall to find his true love is engaged to another man, Turner was busy fighting evil in Middle Earth. The 5ft 10in Turner was digitally shrunk for his role as Kili, one of two dwarf brothers who set out alongside Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins in a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. But with Martin Freeman playing Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage's brooding dwarf chieftan stealing all the screen thunder, you might have missed Aidan's fantastical role - had he not also enjoyed a plotline that involved flirting with Tauriel the elf, played by Evangeline Lilly. Action stations: From left, John Callen, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Adam Brown, Jed Brophy, Peter Hambleton, Ken Stott and Stephen Hunter in a scene from The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies film . He became famous as vampire John Mitchell in the BBC3 supernatural housemates dramedy Being Human . But it seems training to play the warrior dwarf may have helped sculpt the abs that have become famous in their own right. Turner told Empire about the prep needed for the trilogy: 'A lot of going to the gym; a lot of movement classes. Dwarves are just weighed down by everything,' he said. 'They’re not sluggish, they just have this work-horse mentality. When they get going they’re unstoppable.' Turner even popped up in The Tudors in one episode as a richly-dressed character called Bedoli . As John Schofield, Hattie Jacques' lodger and lover, Turner had to don Sixties clothing . Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman as brothers Kili and Fili respectively in a scene from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . Since graduating from The Gaiety School of Acting in 2004, the Dubliner has enjoyed an eclectic range of parts and notched up a number of award nominations. His career in television began in 2007 when he embraced 16th century-style costume to appear in one episode of the television series The Tudors. More period work was to follow when he was chosen to play pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics, followed swiftly by appearances as Ruairí McGowan on The Clinic. But Turner finally had a change of pace in 2008 when he was cast as the undead John Mitchell in the supernatural drama Being Human, about a werewolf, vampire and a ghost who share a house. With his hair slicked back, his face deathly pale, an all-black wardrobe and a set of menacing fangs, the actor earned a new army of fans.

The great religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims that dominates the Middle East has erupted into open conflict  in Yemen, the region’s poorest country, threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war. In a dramatic escalation of the stakes, a Sunni coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels who have swept south through the country. As Yemen veered towards political disintegration, the conflict exploded into a region-wide crisis that could have far-reaching and unpredictable international consequences. Scroll down for video . Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels, pictured people  gather at the site of an explosion near Sana'a Airport . Brent crude oil prices increased by 6 per cent, for example, since many of the world’s oil shipments pass through or past the Bab el-Mandab Strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. But the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in Yemen between its neighbour Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni power, and Iran, the leading Shia power, explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake. Saudi warplanes targeted Houthi positions in the country’s capital Sana’a killing 18 civilians and injuring many more. Britain and America supported the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region. Another nine Sunni states joined the offensive, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, pledging to send aircraft to bomb targets, with Egypt deploying ships. Anticipating the worsening situation, British elite soldiers — in Yemen to train government troops to fight Al Qaeda, which has established its most dangerous branch in the country — pulled out last Friday. This followed a decision by the U .S. to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. As Western forces left, the rebels — trained, armed and funded by Iran — made further advances in the south of the country. The Yemeni president, who is backed by the U.N., was forced to flee his palace in the former British colonial port of Aden on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the Saudi capital, Riyadh. This week, Aden — once one of the British Empire’s most important ports for ships heading to imperial India, and a haven of stability patrolled by officers in pith helmets and colonial shorts — was raked with the sound of gunfire. Just 35 miles to the north, Shia rebels had seized Al Anad air base, which until recently had been used by American counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists. Yemen sits on the extreme end of the Arabian peninsula, with Saudi Arabia to the north — where the 150,000 Saudi troops are now amassing on its border. An armed member of Houthi militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a Saudi air strike in Sana'a, Yemen . A fierce, tribal society, Yemen has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts. Governing the country has been compared with dancing on the heads of snakes. The Houthis — who belong to a relatively obscure branch of Shia Islam — were largely confined to the north of the country and were contained by the country’s longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a wily Arab strongman, until he was overthrown in the course of the Arab Spring in 2011. President Hadi, his weaker successor, never managed to reassert central control, and in September the Houthis took control of the capital Sana’a. In the vacuum created by President Hadi’s weak leadership, Iran saw the opportunity to taunt its old rival by backing the Houthis and establishing its influence in the Saudis’ backyard. But the recent Houthi advances have proved too much for Saudi, whose primary aim is to re-establish order in Yemen. It amassed a formidable coalition — Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Morocco, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt — of Sunni-led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to Iran: stop meddling in Arab affairs. The Saudis also regard Iran’s influence in Yemen as evidence of a much larger drive by Shia Iran for regional dominance. They claim that Iran is using armed proxies to take over other states. Nothing happens in Lebanon, for instance, without the approval of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Hizbollah, which also provides Syria’s beleaguered President Assad with his light infantry. Houthi fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick-up guard a rally protesting Saudi-led airstrikes . For its part, Iran has condemned the air strikes. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said the country ‘considers this action a dangerous step’, adding that military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in Yemen. ‘This invasion will bear no result but expansion of terrorism and extremism throughout the whole region,’ she said. And the truth is that she may well be right. Yemen has a chronic terrorism problem, simply because such a failed state is an ideal operating ground for terrorists. Yemen is not only home to the most tactically lethal branch of Al Qaeda but now ISIS has a foothold there too. On March 20 four ISIS suicide bombers killed 137 Shia outside their mosques in Sana’a. Before the U.S. military moved out of the country, they were allowed to launch drone strikes on Al Qaeda. But now, in their absence, terrorists are no longer being targeted so effectively, and will only flourish as a result. To make matters still more precarious for the West in its fight against terror, Iran and the Shia militias it backs are proving an increasingly vital component of the ground war against ISIS in Iraq, with Iranian commanders directing them and supplying them too. This means the West is walking on diplomatic eggshells. What if Iran took over much of Iraq, whose government and population is largely Shia as well? Would the Saudis stand for that? And if a Shia Houthi government succeeds in Yemen, then wouldn’t Saudi Arabia’s own downtrodden Shia population, some 10-15 per cent of them in the kingdom’s oil-rich Eastern Province, want some independence? The western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant. Washington is unsure whether Iranian strategy is really to establish proxy Shia governments all over the region or simply to use the Houthi in Yemen to taunt Saudi Arabia and pacify the country’s own hardliners. We now have a bizarre — and potentially very dangerous — situation in which U.S. warplanes are providing air cover for Iranian-backed militias in Iraq in a joint effort against ISIS, while 1,200 miles to the south in Yemen, the Americans are helping Saudi pilots bomb Shia insurgents supported by Iran. So the U.S. is bombing Iran’s enemies in one country, while helping to bomb its allies in another. On top of all this, American and Iranian diplomats are resuming their talks about how to restrain Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such is the chaotic and complex nature of affairs in the Middle East. And as the Saudis pledge to resolve their own local difficulty, we can only hold our breath.","Religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims erupted into conflict .

9b86d5045e5e0a361cec8aa70524664fea10f098,"A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook. Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash . Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago. The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands. 'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, ""Heavy rain"",' he said. 'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.' Life record: Chen writes down everything from the people he meets in the street to the weather as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. He has even developed his own language . Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father . Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed. She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep. His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food. His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father. Guide to life: Chen Hongzhi, 25, has had to write everything down after he suffered brain injuries that left him with a five-minute memory, when he was 17 . They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours. She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point. 'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.' Before the accident: Chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . Hard worker: Despite having very little memory, Chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores. A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss. Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it. Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident. A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted. They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months. But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss. This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed. There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies. However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it. Source: Headway: The Brain Injury Association . After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread. Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by. Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said. But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training. He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'. The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce. He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.' Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help. He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour. He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.' In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident. Alike: Chen's story has led to comparisons between himself and Holywood blockbuster Before I Go to Sleep (2014), starring Nicole Kidman as Christine Lucas and Colin Firth as Ben Lucas .","Car crash left Chen Hongzhi with severe brain injuries and little memory .

Chelsey Dunn, 26, was mortified when her partner compared her underwear to that of cross-dressing nanny Mrs Doubtfire. She had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw. Chelsey Dunn, pictured after her breast enlargement, went under the knife her partner, Ross Stephens, left, jokingly compared her padded underwear to Mrs Doubtfire's . Months after the remark, she was boosted from a 34A to a 34DD at a cost of £5,500 and is now delighted to have been able to throw away her old underwear. Miss Dunn, who is now engaged to marry her partner after he proposed following her surgery said: ‘It was just a joke to make me laugh but I had to admit it was true. 'I wanted to be able to wear nice lingerie and backless clothes but I couldn’t because I felt out of proportion without my padded bra on.' Chelsea, pictured at a 34A, had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw . She underwent the operation in January last year and was boosted to a 34DD . Miss Dunn, from Rhyl, South Wales, had been teased over her lack of curves at school and was unkindly nicknamed the ‘ironing board.’ She says she longed for her bust to grow and hoped she was just a late developer, but by her early twenties she was used to concealing her bust. She said: ‘I would buy the thickest padded bras I could find. My friends all joked that they looked like mattress padding. 'For some reason thick padded bras are always beige. They are the most unattractive garments but without them I felt self-conscious.' Months after her operation, her boyfriend proposed in the Disney Princess Castle while the couple were holidaying in Florida and Miss Dunn accepted . It meant she was limited to clothing that she could wear to conceal the bras. She said: ‘Holidays were tricky because I couldn’t wear my padded bra under bikinis and longed to wear strapless and backless dresses like my friends but it was impossible. It was when she was undressing in front of her boyfriend that he teasingly asked her if Mrs Doubtfire wanted her bra back soon that she decided it was time to do something about it. She said: 'It was really funny because I was the first to admit my padded bras were not sexy in the slightest. But it did also make me think enough was enough. My chest had always bothered me why not do something about it?’ She booked a consultation with Transform and her surgeon agreed to boost her from an A to a DD cup.

But in fact, the 33-foot-long bunker built under one of Toronto's most important tourist attractions was 'just a place to hang out', according to its architect. Elton McDonald, 22, has finally unveiled himself as the man behind the mysterious tunnel which took five years to construct. And his pursuits were far from cunning. Scroll down for video . Just for fun! Construction worker Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the underground bunker to watch TV in . Fears: Investigators first thought the 33-foot-long tunnel underneath Toronto could be part of a terror plot . 'Innocent': McDonald says he and a friend spent five years constructing the wood-paneled space underground . 'It wasn't really a tunnel. I was going to expand it to have a couple of rooms,' McDonald, a construction worker, told the Toronto Sun newspaper. 'I was hoping to put in a TV. I did some barbecuing in there. It was more a place to hang out.' Police ignited a frenzy of media speculation in February by announcing the discovery of a 'sophisticated' hand-dug tunnel near a tennis stadium to be used for the Pan Am Games in July. Much of the speculation was linked to concern about a terrorist plot against the Games. McDonald said he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about it so they understood why he was always so dirty . The site: The bunker is underneath tennis courts where the Pan American Games will be hosted this year . McDonald says he had grand plans to add rooms to the underground 'hang out' space in Toronto . Days later, police said they had identified two men who had built the  tunnel but declined to reveal their identities since no crime had been committed. McDonald told the newspaper he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about the project so they would understand why he came home so dirty. When news broke about the tunnel, McDonald said he didn't speak up because he was afraid he'd be in trouble. Police tracked him down after his employer recognized some of the equipment used at the site, McDonald said. Suspicious: Police were baffled to find a rosary and poppy on the door but McDonald says it was a gift . Investigation: Police launched a large-scale investigation into the bunker when it was discovered in January . The tunnel was discovered January 14 in a suburban woodlot. Reinforced with wooden walls and ceiling supports, it had electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt. Police found a rosary with crucifix and a poppy nailed to one of the tunnel's wooden supports. McDonald said his sister gave him the crucifix for good luck after a small cave-in, while he'd found the poppy on Remembrance Day, November 11, when war veterans are honored. Canada has been on heightened alert for terrorist activity since a gunman attacked the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in October after fatally shooting a soldier at the nearby National War Memorial. The attack by a so-called 'lone wolf' Canadian convert to Islam came two days after another convert rammed two soldiers in Quebec with his car, killing one.","Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the tunnel to watch TV and barbecue .

Poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with Bruce. The rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the FA investigate the clash which was sparked when Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face. But the Uruguayan blamed Dean for his reaction after he booked Jack Rodwell for diving. Poyet said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious. ‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that. ‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness. ‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’ Jack Rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving, a decision that led to Poyet's reaction . The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Poyet's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined £25,000 by the FA after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season. Bruce, meanwhile, did not reveal what Poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction. But he admitted it had been unsavoury. ‘I think it’s right that I keep what he said to myself,’ he said. ‘But it wasn’t very pleasant. It wasn’t “have a nice evening, Steve”. ‘But I don’t know why I reacted like that. We all do stupid things but it was handbags. ‘I thank the assistant referee for stepping in. I’ll have to buy him a beer. ‘I just think Gus had seen it differently about Rodwell diving. But the referee got it right. ‘All I said to his assistant was that Rodwell had dived. ‘These things happen in the heat of the moment. Grown men acting like a couple of children. They happen in big games. Let’s forget about it and go and have a glass of wine.’ Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game . The 47-year-old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the KC Stadium . The result moves Hull five points clear of the relegation zone with Sunderland a point behind. And Bruce said: ‘We’re making a fist of it and I would say that is a point gained. We’re six clear of the relegation zone now if you take into account our goal difference. ‘We have to remember it’s our second season in the league. For Sunderland they’ve been there for eight.’ Dame N’Doye opened the scoring in the first half before Rodwell levelled late on, although the ball appeared to go in via his arm. Bruce said: ‘I didn’t see it to be honest, but if Rodwell has said he handled it then I suppose he did. These things happen.’ Hull striker Dame N'Doye (far left) shoots from inside the area to put the Tigers 1-0 up at home to Sunderland .

The goal-kicking forward played in 30 of the Vikings' 32 league and cup matches in 2014 and has been an ever-present so far this season but will sit out Thursday's trip to Salford and will not be back until after Easter. 'Danny has been carrying the injury for the last few weeks,' Widnes coach Denis Betts said. 'It's been affecting the way he's performed. Danny Tickle will be out for at least a month for Widnes Vikings after carrying groin injury for a few weeks . 'He's toughed it out but we need to look at him and do what's best for him.

'We're just being really smart with him. 'He got hit on the head in a game and had a bit of delayed concussion. His symptons have kept resurfacing when he's been putting the effort into training so, under medical advice, we've had to step him back and take our time with him. 'At the moment he's in some kind of sabbatical. He's sat at home waiting for his symptons to calm down. We're monitoring him almost daily. 'When he's ready to go, he'll have to go through six or seven days of training before he's allowed to be up for selection.

India's bowlers were hammered all over Australia between December and mid-February as the team lost their Test series 2-0 and failed to win a single match in the following Tri-series, which also featured England. However, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma have upped their game considerably at the World Cup and have combined with the strong spinners to forge a potent attack. India vice captain Virat Kohli is confident India can upset Australia to reach the World Cup final . The renowned batsman pushes through the nets during practice ahead of Thursday's semi-final . With the help of several run-outs, the Indian bowlers have dismissed the opposition in all seven matches on their way to the semi-finals. Kohli, the leading light in the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up, said everyone was aware of the areas where improvement was required and he was pleased by the way the pacemen had responded. India's bowlers including Mohit Sharma (centre) have picked up their game after early struggles Down Under . India's Mohammed Shami (right) celebrates after taking a wicket in the quarter final defeat of Bangladesh . 'The way the bowlers have reacted and the way they have performed with the composure and the confidence and the aggression all together, it's been wonderful to watch,' he told Cricket Australia's website. 'So we expect the bowlers to step up if you want to beat quality sides in the world and the way they have done this in this World Cup has been commendable. 'We've played the right kind of cricket and the difference now is how our bowling attack has come into play in this World Cup taking 70 wickets in seven games.

'That's probably been the difference, and if we continue to do that we have a great chance come game day.' India have not beaten Australia in any format since they arrived Down Under in late November but Kohli thinks Thursday at the Sydney Cricket Ground is the perfect opportunity to break that cycle. 'There couldn't be a better time for us,' he said. 'It's an opportunity for us to do justice to the way we've played so far in Australia, and we haven't had the results.'","India face Australia in the Cricket World Cup semi-finals on Thursday .

Liam Edwards, 29, walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, with the #BanHalal stickers and stuck them on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle. He was stopped by security and, after police were called, officers searched his home and found cannabis and a letter addressed from the Beer and Bacon Company of Great Britain which made reference to an 'anti-Jihadi frog'. Scroll down for video . Liam Edwards, 29 (pictured outside court, right), walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, and plastered the #BanHalal stickers on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle . The sticker which Edwards plastered on the supermarket chicken said: 'Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism.' However, he has insisted he is an animal rights activist and that the incident was not racially-aggravated . Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how there was also reference that he had browsed patriotsagainstIslam.co.uk on his home computer. Edwards, of Salford, admitted criminal damage in relation to the supermarket incident on February 18 and possession of cannabis. However, he denied that he was 'racially motivated' when he carried out the attack on the supermarket chicken and will face trial in July over the charge. It emerged that £16.50 worth of chicken had to be destroyed as a result of his actions. At the court hearing today, it was said that he was simply drawing attention to the 'inhumane' halal methods of animal slaughter, which involves slitting the animal's throat to allow the blood to drain out. Holly Holden, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant has gone to the supermarket and placed stickers on packets of chicken saying 'halal is barbaric and funds terrorism'. The chicken had to be destroyed because the stickers could not be removed. 'He says he wished to draw attention to the inhumane halal methods of animal slaughter and that was his motivation rather than racial prejudice. 'The point about animal cruelty could be expressed in a different way without the suggestion that halal and terrorism are linked.'

Mike Cahill, defending, said Edwards was protesting against halal slaughter and the reference to terrorism in the stickers referred neither to race nor religion. He said: 'He uses the word terrorism but that can't denote race or indeed religion.' Bailing him until a further hearing on July 23, District Judge James Hatton added: 'You have pleaded guilty to some matters but not guilty to the racially-aggravated criminal damage. There will have to be a trial.' Judge Hatton told Edwards that the conditions of his bail including not going near the Sainsbury's supermarket in Salford. Halal involves cutting through arteries in the neck . HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON-HALAL . In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered.

But Panasonic is hoping to make protecting your home and family a lot easier, and more mobile. The manufacturer has announced the world’s first 4G surveillance camera called Nubo that detects and alerts homeowners to intruders and can be fitted inside and out the house. Home security: Built-in sensors detect human shapes and the camera will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. A message will then be sent via mobile (screenshot pictured) to alert a homeowner . Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Built-in sensors detect human shapes and will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses. When connected to a Wi-Fi network this increases to 30fps at 1080p. In addition to 4G, the Nubo works on 2G and 3G connections and because it is IP-66 weather resistant it can, in theory, be mounted anywhere with a mobile data signal. Mobile support including GPRS, 2G, 3G and 4G: Nubo will offer connectivity with leading wireless carriers, with the Vodafone being the first partner to launch with in Europe Outdoor ready . (IP-66): Nubo is IP-66 rated weather resistant and can be used indoors and outdoors . Smart human detection: Nubo’s advanced video analytics identify when a person walks in front of the camera and sends an alert to a mobile app . Links with smart home devices: Nubo’s wireless radio technology means it can communicate with external sensors, such as door or motion sensors. Battery power: Nubo can be connected to an external battery, allowing for temporary use in places without a power connection . Security: Videos, audio and images are automatically transferred to a cloud-based storage system, protected by bank-level SSL security and encrypted passwords . ‘In the past, consumers had to choose between a fixed Wi-Fi home monitoring product, a fixed professional surveillance or a mobile video recording product,’ a Panasonic spokesman told MailOnline. ‘To solve this problem, Panasonic Cameramanager is launching Nubo, a new standalone camera that allows users to have all the benefits of a mobile security camera, with the advantage of 4G connectivity.’ ‘Consumers have long had to compromise on mobility and connectivity when it came to their surveillance needs, bound either by location or connectivity,’ added Tijmen Vos, CTO of Panasonic Cameramanager. ‘Our vision is to deliver a product that allows users the freedom and flexibility of choosing where the camera can be used and the confidence in knowing that the data created is securely transmitted and stored. ‘With the introduction of Nubo, we’re putting the control of safety and surveillance into the user’s hands.’ When a recording begins, the owner is sent an alert via a smartphone app and can then use the Nubo’s two-way communication tool to talk to the person being filmed. Secret eye: The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses (camera pictured) Elsewhere, the camera has an infrared detectors and works in low lighting. During its press conference, Panasonic also announced it is launching its own mobile network using Vodafone’s infrastructure - making it a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) - and service plans for the Nubo on this network will start at £5 ($7) a month. This includes cloud storage, but a microSD card slot will store footage if the mobile data fails. This means it can be used without a service plan, too. The cheapest plan will include 250 alarms per month and seven days of cloud storage for video clips. Additional plans will be available up to in a £33 ($50) a month for 2,500 alarms and 90 days of cloud storage. Once the data runs out alarms will still be sent but users will need to buy more to view the clips. Nubo's app will work with Android and iOS and users will be able to watch footage live, control how long Nubo records for and see a history log of activity. Nubo ships in November but can be pre-ordered in the UK and Netherlands from April. Panasonic said it plans to launch the camera in the US and other regions by March next year.","Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

f9c3963bc803d207971782644c5ed3a6a32f7a0a,"Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. ""We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,"" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. ""We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need."" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. ""He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife."" ""I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing."" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. ""It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,"" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. ""Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society."" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to ""reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial."" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant ""that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.""​ .","Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .

Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned: 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'. Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator. Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard. Dean Wilson (left), 37, was jailed after running over his father Norman (right) with his Mazda because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard . Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail. He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.' 'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me. 'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs. 'It was excruciating.' He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'. Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street. 'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added. The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him. 'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back. 'I've got to get away and move on with my life.' The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father. Norman Wilson was treated for broken ribs, bruising (pictured) and grazes after he was run over by his son . He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court. He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech. 'He turned and saw his son saying he didn't want his kids or his ex-partner at his dad's house or he would kill him. 'Norman Wilson said the defendant indicated he had smashed the windscreen. 'The defendant said he had been told Norman had been going to bed with his ex and Dean Wilson said he was going to kill him and added, 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.' Ms Pritchard added: 'The defendant then jumped in his car and came at speed and hit Norman Wilson so he was thrown in the air and as he landed a few yards from his own vehicle the defendant drove at him again and ran over his leg.' Witnesses said they saw the defendant drive the Mazda at his father before reversing over him. The 60-year-old (pictured today), who is now left using a mobility scooter, is terrified and planning to move . Norman Wilson initially laughed at his son's threat but now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is terrified after being run over outside his home (pictured) Natalie Mosley, who witnessed the incident, told the court that she put herself in the path of Dean Wilson's vehicle during another attempt to drive over him. Ms Pritchard explained how Norman Wilson remembers someone holding his head and saying he was dying when things became blurred. He was treated for broken ribs, bruising and grazes at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and is now left using a mobility scooter. In a victim impact statement, Mr Wilson said he feels threatened and that he has to leave the area. Matthew Donkin, defending, said: 'Dean Wilson behaved out of character and gave leave to all of his good senses. 'He has been the principle carer for his children aged seven and eight and his 14-year-old stepson. 'There was a lack of premeditation until he got in his vehicle. He immediately admitted what he had done and made full admissions.' Sentencing, Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Your relationship with your father broke down badly by your suspicions that rightly or wrongly he was involved sexually with your former partner. 'Travelling at a speed estimated at 20mph you drove at him and knocked him into the road and you then quite deliberately reversed over him. 'He was extremely lucky not to have sustained more serious injuries.' Dean Wilson was also handed a four year driving ban and told his car would be confiscated.

3fab252754add85a7d15bca628699e95545f0458,"Johnny Sexton must come through 'modified training' to prove his fitness for Ireland's pivotal RBS 6 Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff. Ireland's lynchpin fly-half has 'hit all his markers so far' in battling hamstring trouble, but is still fighting to recover to face Wales on Saturday, according to team manager Mick Kearney. Number eight Jamie Heaslip was due to take contact training on Monday for the first time since fracturing three vertebrae in his back against France on February 14. Ireland's Johnny Sexton is winning his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday . The Leinster stalwart is now expected to be fit to face Wales, where victory would leave Ireland almost nailed-on for the Grand Slam. 'Johnny Sexton continues to improve following a mild hamstring strain,' said Kearney. 'As a precaution he will have modified training during the early part of the week with an expectation that he will train fully towards the end of the week. 'We are very happy where he is at, at the moment. He has hit all his markers so far. 'Johnny will have modified training in the early part of the week and if he comes through training through the latter part of the week, he will be available for selection. Sexton has come through all the tests asked of him so far but there is still a chance he could miss the game . 'Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection. 'Sean O'Brien and Jared Payne have both progressed well through the return to play protocol and will be re-introduced to full training during the week. 'Johnny will have modified training today. Jamie will train fully today.' Team manager Kearney admitted British and Irish Lions Sexton and Heaslip are both 'extremely eager' to face Wales this weekend. Ireland are gunning to retain the Six Nations title for the first time since 1949, and also claim a second Grand Slam in six years. Sexton limped out of the latter stages of Ireland's 19-9 victory over England in Dublin on March 1 and has been battling to recover ever since. The 29-year-old has a history of hamstring problems, but Kearney does not expect that to colour his recovery. Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection . 'From what I remember the last time he had a problem was between the Australia game and New Zealand game, in the November series just over 12 months ago,' said Kearney. 'He actually recovered pretty quickly then. 'He came off at half-time against Australia and was fit to play and played the whole game, or most of the game against New Zealand without any issue. 'That certainly wouldn't be a worry at the moment. 'Jamie (Heaslip) hasn't taken any contact yet. He will train fully today and provided there is no reaction he should be available for selection. 'They are extremely eager, absolutely: very eager to play.' Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy has been drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad . Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy was drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad for the final two weeks of Six Nations action. Ireland must win in Wales and Scotland to secure the Grand Slam and retain their Six Nations title - but, barring injury, will do so without veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy. The 35-year-old Leinster centre has been omitted from Schmidt's training squad, with Ulster's Darren Cave and Munster's Keith Earls providing midfield cover. Team manager Kearney refused to accept D'Arcy's absence could spark the end of his glittering 81-cap Test career however. His long-term centre sparring partner Brian O'Driscoll retired last summer, but D'Arcy himself has always been determined to push on to this year's World Cup. 'That is a selection issue, yes,' said Kearney of D'Arcy's absence. 'Gordon has been an unbelievable servant for Irish rugby. 'He's back fit, back playing for Leinster, so certainly I wouldn't rule him out for future consideration.' Both teams must give consent for Saturday's Millennium Stadium match to be played under a closed roof. Team manager Kearney said Ireland will delay their decision until later in the week, and base it around the chances of rain. 'We are waiting to see what the weather forecast turns out like,' said Kearney. 'We don't have to make a decision on that until 7pm on Thursday. 'We will wait until then before we make a final decision. 'I think overall, our preference would be for a dry day and decent weather, rather than wet and miserable weather. 'In good weather our preference would be for it to be open.'","Fly-half Johnny Sexton has 'hit all his markers' in battling hamstring issues .
