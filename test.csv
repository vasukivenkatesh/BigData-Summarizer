With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.","Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga.

3da746a7d9afcaa659088c8366ef6347fe6b53ea,"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.","Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .

A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool.

'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.

Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land.

6394f51b120ceb3da5e7b53dd5167fc4cf80b514,"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.","Figures show that while millions still tune in they listen for shorter bursts .

57f68638739c3a1de8d9922b389d6ded39977012,"At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.","Reanne Evans faced Ken Doherty in World Championship qualifier .

20778c35c19d741cc182719de336d71e1a0b228e,"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute.

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos .

Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between €1million and €5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.","Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, has been charged with multiple manslaughter .

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011.

391b4610e3a9dcefd61e428155cc5afb2683124c,"(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a ""counterterrorism operation"" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, ""The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine."" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown ""no interest in my case."" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from ""one Jew to another"" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and ""de-conflict"" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.","U.S. hostage Warren Weinstein is believed to have been accidentally killed in counter-terrorism strike .

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices.

Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.","Australian Fashion Report revealed the Australian-sold brands and companies that ignore the exploitation of their overseas workers .

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34-year-old’s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.","Prasanna Arulchelvam leapt into van as it sped away but was pushed out .

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated.

'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe.

75fdaee82f6d0545a86b9d28b947186ce4b2a088,"(CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, ""Finding Your Roots,"" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, ""all things being equal, I would definitely take it out."" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, ""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth."" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates ""agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with."" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: ""Finding Your Roots"" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not ""60 Minutes"" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  ""asked us to edit out something."" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, ""Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964."" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel ""vulnerable."" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his ""distant relative.""  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.","Ben Affleck admits he asked PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" to avoid mentioning his slave-owning ancestor .

42482902d939b1d1e1182a58a5b313fde9b8484f,"Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened – they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well – I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.","Mered Medhanie and Ermias Ghermay 'have made £72m in last two years'

But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries.

8cbab1e00c52ae5b6405e221fc0eefeae00e3454,"After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to ""testimony"" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said.

""This is a problem that is off the charts historically,"" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. ""Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries."" He concluded, ""We're in unchartered territory here."" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. ""We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,"" he said. ""Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do."" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. ""We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,"" McGurk said. ""They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,"" he acknowledged. ""But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani."" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: ""The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.""","Obama's point man in ISIS fight doesn't rule out U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria .

Some people it worries to death and others really don’t worry too much.’ Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . ‘I promise you he has not dyed his hair,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he’s just not like that.’ Mr Farage said he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy . The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute.

Jamyra Gallmon, 21, has been charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 in Washington, D.C. The woman admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale Donovan hotel with the intention of robbing him. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed on Thursday that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . According to Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing including black boots, black pants and a black hooded jacket, the room door was open when she arrived. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9. Police confirmed that this was Gallmon . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a teacher said on Thursday.

Gallmon made an initial appearance on the felony murder charge Superior Court in DC on Thursday. The 21-year-old attended the Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach toldFox 5 on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. She graduated in 2011. Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime.

a8eb7e7d14517a32761b8609a6f4b0b1c7de9597,"Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.","Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women .

76e0aa30e7033a161a11ce7c4692822772f63ade,"English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.","ISIS has announced that all nurses working for them must speak English .

7f53ab255bad30f06dccb9041db53f4b8f5ad29c,"Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'","Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta .

But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups.

Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'","Fulham 2-2 Wigan Athletic: CLICK HERE to read the match report .

Jet Set Candy, which offers a collection of destination-specific charms aimed at helping people to choose where they should head on their travels, enables you to take your pick of Britain’s Royals with the Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm, giving users eight possibilities for a 'future husband' - including 'King-to-be George'. 'Fancy your chances with Prince Harry? Got eyes for a Duke? Tie the knot with a British Royal and go from commoner to Queen. Your palace awaits!' reads the description of the fanciful charm, which comes in 14K gold vermeil or sterling silver for $198 and $148, respectively. Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as ‘Duke’, ‘Marquess’, ‘Earl’, ‘Viscount’, ‘Baron’ and ‘Commoner’, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage – or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more.

8a785f86259fbb58cea178a9f3bc3753cb98bf63,"First it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep Aidan Turner's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit BBC Sunday night series Poldark. Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'","Photos taken for BBC show Being Human see Aidan Turner with a full 'rug'

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.","Miliband overtakes David Cameron as the most popular political leader .

Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner.""

Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, ""Okay, great."" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, ""Really?"", so I said, ""Yeah, he's going to do it."" 'She said, ""Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant.""

Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinée performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.","Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .

Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.","Gianni Paladini has registered as director of Bradford's holding company .

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85),  Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used: Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals: Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 .

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .","Lee Tomlin's superb solo effort gave Middlesbrough a 50th minute lead .

James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  £200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a £200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for – let's not be shy – a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.'

Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up – and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. ‘I’ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,’ he said. ‘But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be.

40aaac4df33e238efdecaed02c9adaa916975c2e,"Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.","Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching display .

00110802bc6eae0e8e4d3d22e27f458f41be2b22,"For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.","Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams .
Scientists now believe a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks .

Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him ""six feet under,"" according to court documents.

The Spaniard has been linked with the managerial job at Sampdoria after it emerged that Sinisa Mihajlovic - the current Blucerchiati boss - is being lined up to replace Benitez at Napoli. But Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has taken inspiration from a favourite chant of the Goodison Park and Old Trafford terraces, appearing to quash rumours that a job swap is imminent. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez jokes with Switzerland Gokhan Inler (right) during a training session . Benitez challenges  Argentinian forward Gonzalo Higuain during a training session earlier today . 'I could take Benitez, but I'd have to take him to see a dietician first,' Ferrero told Radio Crc. 'Anyway, if Mihajlovic does leave, I've already got a replacement. You all say he's leaving, even if I don't know anything about it. 'As far as I am concerned, he's staying. If he were to leave, I'd know who to replace him with. Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot.

The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had 'a lot to offer this country'. Lord Prescott's intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles's so-called 'black spider' memos. Lord Prescott, left, said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the 'trouble' the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'.","Ex deputy PM said there was no problem with Charles writing to ministers .

Fashion fans who follow many of the top bloggers on Instagram experienced an extreme case of déjà vu over the weekend after the same dress was modelled by no less than 50 fashionistas .

Adweek reports that the bloggers received ‘unspecified compensation’ in return for giving the dress their seal of approval. ‘The goal was to make [the potential customer] stop in her feed and ask why all her favorite bloggers are wearing this dress, and what is Design Lab? Using Instagram as that vehicle is a logical choice, especially when it comes to fashion,’ said Lord & Taylor's CMO Michael Crotty. Many of the posts generated more than 1,000 Likes each, with several surpassing 5,000 Likes and some reaching rarified levels like 13,000 Likes.

The Lord & Taylor deal highlights the gray area of bloggers receiving payment for promoting some goods and services, while others they lend their credability to for free. While newspapers and websites such as the Daily Mail Online have to be upfront and clearly state when something is paid for content, the rules are less stringent on social media. Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to their massive Twitter followings. In leaked Sony emails in December, it was revealed that comedian Kevin Hart had been paid $2 million to send out tweets to his 14.8 million followers promoting The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, and the Idris Elba film No Good Deed. 'Make sure yo go support my Brother @willpowerpacker this weekend by seeing ""No Good Deed"" .... @TherealTaraji & Idris kill this movie!' wrote the actor on September 12.

'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National.

The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around £1.49 a month to as high as £14.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay £17.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.","Tinder only displays the last 34 photos - but users can easily see more .

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour. At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a £7,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I’m so happy for Mike that he’s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can’t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour.

01b4613f86c44ceec7beb897c5167088c61deeac,"Lucky: Selena Dicker, 38, outran the avalanche on Mount Everest in the wake of the Nepal quake . A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker – who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche – described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise £45,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London,  escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers – from South Africa – managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London – Chloe Pincho and Brennan White – were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover.

23052beb2829d49cdbbf265dacb09344585becd0,"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that ""the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to ""intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country."" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. The conflict has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey.

06b6e2a8279feb2c6be3c3b8a2a7052df536a39a,"An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.","Geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and 'Jesus Family tomb'

4776b2e669e75793a4ac2a5c5a9b718070d39007,"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

d604fabaf467a3c3e29e2314304c9cadedb31514,"Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making ""stereotypical assumptions"" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.","Survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people .

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video .

The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia.

Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds.

Arsenal may pull out of the running to sign Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling following recent events . Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . Sterling's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool's permission is said to have surprised those at north London.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor .","Francis Coquelin superb in protecting Arsenal back four at Turf Moor .

And now, Rita Ora - who is only 24 and has already made the transition from a Kosovan-born fledgling singer to one of the globe's most successful stars - has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range. For her latest collaboration with adidas Originals, Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Scroll down for video . Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future . Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I’ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body-mind-soul connection, about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, couldn't be happier with the final result. She said: 'I love being able to go into design meetings with all these crazy ideas and then be able to create a product that hasn’t existed before. From the initial stages to seeing my fans wearing the clothes and shoes - it’s been an amazing experience.'

The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself . Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there’s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I’m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I’m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I’ve always loved that London street style, but I’ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I’ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I’ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I’m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'. Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita, pictured judging on The Voice, explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career . As well as conquering the fashion world, the humble star has been busy making music, starring in Fifty Shades Of Grey and spending time with her beau, Ricky Hilfiger. So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it’s probably fortunate that I don’t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world.  'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It’s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I’m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I’d love to continue down that path. But music has always and will always be my main love and passion. 'In five years' time, hopefully I will still be creating music and being able to live my dreams surrounded with the people I love.

The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is widely regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made. But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie. That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below. A stunning Ferrari - which is almost identical to the model driven in cult eighties classic film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for auction . The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (pictured) is regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made . But its most famous moment came it was used as the car for the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller, starring Matthew Broderick . In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello. One of just 16 in existence, it has a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp. It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph. It will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around £8 million.

It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph and in the auction catalogue, RM Sotheby's called it 'the most celebrated open-air Ferrari ever made' and 'an automobile with few peers' But it is expected to sell for significantly more after a model previously owned by the French actor Alain Delon and requiring a full restoration sold for £12.5 million earlier this year. Peter Wallman, car specialist at RM Sotheby's, said: 'Perhaps the most beautiful convertible car ever made, and featuring the powerful Colombo designed 3.0-litre V12 engine, this spacious and versatile two-seat sports car with race car performance is the ultimate road going Ferrari of all time.' The car's ability to be driven at high speed on the track as well as comfortably across continents boosted appeal to a number of high profile customers. Hollywood star James Coburn owned one - with Chris Evans buying it in 2008 for a then world record £5.6 million. The Delon car sold for more than twice this figure seven years later. This model, known as chassis 2505 GT, was originally bought by an Italian driver before the ownership was passed to a Swiss person. It was later owned by a Brit and is currently back in Italian ownership .

35d559779b0b9849bd394864a13c14eaa845f877,"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

b91e6223fb91f7a29fcc925a7a04ef72075eaab2,"Britain's five highest-earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of £690,000 a year. The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet – and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between £400,000 and £500,000 and a total of 177 received more than £200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed £100,000-£200,000. The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers’ money paid to dentists for NHS work, following Labour’s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than £500,000. They shared a total of about £3.4million – an average of £690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned £400,000 to £499,999 from the NHS, 30 received £300,000 to £399,999, 131 pocketed £200,000 to £299,999 and 1,617 received £100,000 to £199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E … when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a £2,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said: ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added: ‘It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them … Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist £25, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly £300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 21,500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13, but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top-earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee of MPs, said: ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self-employed individuals or companies, some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.","Highest-earning NHS dentists earn almost five times more than Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet .

91b802bf26bef2ab42a5f02b4beab497f690a8f8,"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the £5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the £10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at £26billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed £200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for £130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out £130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget £19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of £19.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, £130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, £19.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for £14.99 in 2013. Aldi's £19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At £19.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.","Running is often celebrated as a cheap sport to take up .

7638ccd8fff2a7a5c0541faf3b52dbb443845e49,"An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, ""Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall."" I remember saying, ""Why, what happened?"" He said, ""He has fallen from a ladder."" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, ""You need to get here as soon as you can mum."" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking ""danger high voltage"". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues.","Nathan Brown, 19, was working with father David testing lights in a factory .

FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level.

But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.","Pound near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 .

Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

c1162ae920da18097cca6e8d9520e6d9411037b1,"The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared . The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene.

Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police assume Luke has spent 36 hours without food or water and on Saturday night would have experienced temperatures as low as 8 degree Celsius. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Sergeant Greg Paul says the search is focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. The Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park, central Victoria, where Luke went missing on Friday . 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas.

'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe.

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'","Lavall Hall, 25, was suffering psychotic episode when fatally shot by police .

30d677eb679d52fe11e5dd4deeb37c811f4a3bca,"Mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children, researchers claim. A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say ""shaped"", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'","Researchers observed random parents with children at NY playgrounds .

cdf27c4ae412a4b9b5841d2e31d4d8c8314c80ee,"Nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler Mikaeel Kular. The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 – the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'","Fife Council launched internal investigation following accusations .

57bad62c610754c019aaceed38930ba07cdf1656,"Rape: Edwin 'Jock' Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, ""How are you going to do that?"" He just said, ""A call that I can make,"" and I said ""Why don't you do it?"" 'He said: ""You know what you can do that will make me do it.""' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues.

6721edf88c95f480a4db2c63649dbb03736aeadf,"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic will line up against former club Barcelona on Tuesday .

5cf4682cd03238d5867027ce9492b626cd1ed011,"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

3815d19af18ff22be6ad6095722d7367bb7271af,"A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after drinking sessions .

Silva was substituted in the defeat by Barcelona in midweek and the injury is still keeping him out . 'Game Ready', as seen being used by Thiago Silva, is a cold therapy compression system used to treat sports injuries. It circulates cold water around the injury, cooling it down with the aim to bring players back from injury as soon as possible. He posted an update on Instagram, writing: 'Guys, I'm here to thank you all for your prayers!

PSG coach Laurent Blanc said on Friday: 'Thiago Silva is out for Nice even if his injury is not as bad as first feared.' The game against Nice comes more than 24 hours before league leaders Lyon face a tough task at home against fifth-place St Etienne. A win in south east France would put the French champions a point clear of their closest rivals. Lyon could take back top spot on Sunday but Blanc's side will have a game in hand at the close of the weekend. 'It is not easy to prepare for this match,' Blanc said. 'We must turn in up in championship mode. In this final stretch, we no longer have room for error.' Laurent Blanc said that Silva's injury is not as bad as first feared, and that was confirmed by the Brazilian .

d25d52c434a13c1df5faa593e8a097d2f501a2b6,"(CNN)You know the phrase ""dodging a bullet""? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the ""smart bullets"" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman ""repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,"" a DARPA statement said. ""Additionally,"" the statement said, ""a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target."" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. ""True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,"" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. ""This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,"" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",".50-caliber bullets equipped with optical sensors can follow moving targets .

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread .

EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers.

Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer .

929791869be6c996e8d9f14626c30f157ed9ed59,"The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England’s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell’s century. But ‘the Burnley Lara’, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England’s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith’s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord’s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India’s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England’s noses in front until the wait for Anderson’s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.","West Indies reach 155 for four at stumps on day two of first Test .

d07fd09ea28118a9090a0b5eea0bda0f33456cb0,"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

Tragedy: Pensioner Molly Wood died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.'

In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.'

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members – something that anyone can become by joining free – while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury.

And the Southampton defender, who is being tracked by Manchester United and Chelsea, has fuelled talk that he could quit St Mary's this summer by insisting he wants to play Champions League football. Clyne's excellent displays for the Saints have thrust him into the forefront of Hodgson's plans. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne poses with a WWE title belt while attending a pay-per-view event . Clyne joined Carlton Cole (left) to speak at at a Football Fighting Ebola event in London . He has started England's previous four matches - including the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovenia and Lithuania. Tottenham's Kyle Walker and Arsenal's Calum Chambers are also in contention for England's right-back berth - but Clyne has revealed Hodgson has told him the shirt is his as long as he keeps on performing. Speaking at the Football Fighting Ebola fundraising event in London, he said: 'Roy just said that ""You’ve done ever so well since coming in. It’s like you have been playing international football for a long time. The right back spot is yours at the moment, if you can continue on"". 'I’ve settled in well with the England squad. If I keep on putting in performances and keep on improving as a player, I can hopefully make the position my own and look to make tournaments and hopefully win tournaments with England as well.' Southampton have opened talks with Clyne, who was spotted at a WWE event in the capital on Monday night, over a new contract but face a huge fight to keep him beyond the end of the season. United are understood to be leading the race to land Clyne in the summer, but Chelsea have entered the race for his signature. The Southampton defender has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Manchester United . And the 24-year-old has openly admitted he is eager to start his Champions League career. 'I see myself hopefully playing in the Champions League and competing for titles and trophies. That’s what I’m aiming for,' he said. 'I’m definitely ambitious. Every player would love to be playing Champions League and winning trophies and titles. 'That’s what you play football for, that’s the dream. 'I would say Champions League is the next step in my progression. I think I need experience playing European football. 'We’re doing well with Southampton. Hopefully we can get there. That would be great.' Clyne attended the WWE's London edition of their show 'Raw' along with Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha on Monday night.

Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then.

After going back inside his house to find he son missing, he made the horrifying realization that he backed over Jackson with his truck. Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up and when the front wheels back around, he essentially walked right into the side of the vehicle. 'When I got out of the truck, I hopped out of the truck to run to the back door and hopped up on the stoop and the back door was wide open,' Brian said. Bayer said he wishes he could have done something to prevent his son's cruel fate and describes himself as the kind of father who would check the floor to make sure there was no change or small objects his son could accidentally swallow. 'I went flying out the back door basically to see him on the driveway, and um…he had already been hit at that point in time and I had backed over him,' he added.

dce1580f3a2630564b7cbad90216ed75a00318cf,"Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that’s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a lethal injection Thursday in Texas .

It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

35b061a74f06747135e4447859c4ccd95ba4cb2b,"Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues – but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE – WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I’m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version – and Arkansas' – expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.","'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Republican Gov.

54f645a1e8fe742206af8cd184e3400655229d31,"Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.","Russian intelligence chiefs took part in secret meeting with U.S. officials .

But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution.

The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature.

However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque?

He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish.

c4c46eb3bcb0a1b5fecb21e6ea8ccf23f46655c2,"A widow who was left £15million by a high-rolling gambler has launched a multi-million pound lawsuit against his family – claiming she is owed up to £385million more. Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least £400million when he died and the £15million left to her was an ‘absurd presentation’ of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just £1.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at £41.5million, says she is owed a ‘reasonable provision’ following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as ‘Black Jack’, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled £1.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow’s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon’s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal’s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a £1million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received £15.4million and he also put £20million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian émigré parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top £1billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for £58million - more than £700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for £55million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for £130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a £150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around £56million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple’s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain’s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth £400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a £50million ‘secret stash’ hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a ‘strong’ case that her husband had access to ‘very considerable resources’, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: ‘It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.’ Mr Dellal’s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal’s wealth meant there was ‘no prospect’ of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an £8.5million mansion in Regent’s Park, central London, a £3million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple’s £5million home in Hampshire, a £1.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost £6million and has investments in the Middle East worth £26.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been ‘somewhat diminished’ recently, although Mr Dellal’s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal’s case without further scrutiny of her late husband’s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.","Jack Dellal left his entire estate to wife Ruanne but it was worth just £15.4m .

Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Nicholas Pence, 25, (left) and his father David, 56, (right) were shot dead 'execution-style' at home on Wednesday night after a football party in their garage, or 'man cave'. Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide — obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right. 'This had to be a random act. It had to be.'","Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, 56, had friends round to celebrate a victorious football game on Wednesday in their rural New Orleans home .

1ca36d545c702dec959bd0a59ae1870da8536793,"This eighteen-month-old boy pulled a rice-cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head, burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind. As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes. That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed because I was surrounded by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family, my friends, the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed. The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, ""they're thinking my arse looks big"". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life .","Baby Seng, from Laos, is the little boy who touched Turia Pitt's heart .

Roberto Mancini has Liverpool midfielder Leiva and Barcelona's Song, currently on loan at West Ham, on his list of alternatives if Jovetic and Toure prove too costly. Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Italia: 'Dreams are beautiful, I'm trying to prepare something and I hope my dreams come true.

Alex Song has impressed during his loan spell at West Ham United and would be available for a transfer . 'Jovetic? In the past there was something, especially last summer. We had gone quite a bit forward in the negotiations, we were hoping to conclude the deal but then Negredo became injured and Manchester City changed their minds. 'He is a great player, he fits the profile of the player we are looking for. He is not very young but he is fully mature and still has a lot to give. He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony.

Her father, John, said yesterday that he, Miss Buckley's mother Marian and her brothers Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Friends and family have paid tribute to Karen Buckley - pictured with her brothers (l-r) Brendan, Damien and Kieran - after a four-day police search found her body yesterday . Her body was found at High Craigton farm after a huge search was launched to find her earlier this week . Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen’s former  school principal, Susan O’Keefe, said: ‘She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It’s sad. We are here on a fine summer’s day but Karen is not. We’re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.’ Karen was a ‘great all-rounder’, participating in ladies’ football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O’Keefe added. ‘At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009.

'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are absolutely heartbroken. Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than £50,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching £50,001 - ten times the initial target of £5,000.

Another baby is dressed up as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache . One sleeping newborn is sporting a completely knitted Wonder Woman costume . Art, design and photography community BoredPanda has created a thread encouraging parents to upload cute images of their babies showcasing their parents' 'true nerdy colors.' And of course, obliging parents have taken to the thread with professional photography shots of their trussed up newborns. Dressed as characters ranging across fantasy and sci-fi movies, books, TV shows and comic books, the adorable babies are seen in different scenarios and positions that have clearly been carefully arranged by their parents. A few of the images have even been subject to careful doctoring via Photoshop, in order to make the scenarios more realistic. Spiderman's a popular choice!

41c6edecee127c396d17e2e9115a4a89252cc52b,"(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to ""gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,"" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward ""other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,"" according to the commission. ""PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,"" commission President Michael Picker said. ""The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again."" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. ""Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,"" Tony Earley said. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

20e6d0d3071c6588894885da2c015064095c66af,"A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa.","Jamal al-Labani was a Oakland, California, gas station owner, as well as a husband and a father-of-three .

6d9493fe42df31e6e18b3345652a0d748820589f,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

c34d84d38ccfd021ba0b3712dc23feadd455af5b,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News.

2d4a9718592d8ab6a96ad11d6396196fa855767a,"A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for , Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'","Tong Shao, 20, was an international student from China attending Iowa State University .

His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured; . His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.","Baby Sonit Awal found in rubble of Nepal earthquake, Sunday morning .

A Florida man who was high on a designer drug called Flakka stripped and ran naked through traffic in Fort Lauderdale to escape from imaginary killers who he believed stole his clothes and wanted to murder him. Matthew Kenney, 34, told police he smoked Flakka before he streaked though traffic early on Saturday evening while only wearing a pair of sneakers. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances, has been nicknamed '$5 insanity' for its mind-bending effects and cheap cost. After he was arrested, Kenney told police he would 'rather die than be caught by these unknown people', the Sun Sentinel reported. He added that 'if I got hit by a car they would stop chasing me' according to a Fort Lauderdale Police reported. Kenney has previous arrests for disorderly conduct, making a riot and possession of a controlled substance. He was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Flakka is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP, a synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone. That is the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Scroll down for video .

7752c685358c5badf6dd5f3798386e9ff64dac3c,"A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

9f81c3049ff1b636ba416283ba4f5326fd578cc8,"She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match. The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, ""Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,""' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS. A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.","Jennifer Pagonis has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer . Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa?

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 .

d6a9784d1ffee56969b3e54ebd39fe3621470c4f,"A former lager lout who ballooned to 24 stone has lost nearly half his body weight by giving up his favourite drink. Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn’t want to look like a ‘beached whale’ next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: ‘I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. ‘I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.’ Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: ‘I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. ‘All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. ‘They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.’ Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet – and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: ‘I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. ‘I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.’ After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: ‘I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. ‘Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. ‘I decided I had to change.’ Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: ‘I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. ‘When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. ‘After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. ‘I got a taste for it and started going all the time.’ Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: ‘The biggest change was kicking the booze.

Meteorologists say early indicators show that an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit the region, with heavy rain possible from Thursday. The State Emergency Service was deluged with calls for assistance last week and has more than 4,000 jobs from the 24,196 requests still to be completed. SES spokeswoman Stephanie Wills says the organisation is concerned that more storms will these hamper clean-up efforts. Scroll down for video . Meteorologists say early indicators show an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit again bringing heavy rain from Thursday through to Saturday .

Residents who have been hit by wild weather across New South Wales are being warned to brace for more floods and damage with another storm predicted to hit this week . People struggle against the heavy rain and strong wind on the streets in the Sydney CBD last week . 'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.' Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott said a trough of low pressure was forming along the coast, and would hit heaviest in the far northern parts of the state.

'It looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week, but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we've seen last week,' Ms Westcott said. 'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week’s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit. 'Obviously we're trying to get through has many as we can before next system hits,' she said.

The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil: Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever: She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker: Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools. As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.","Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York got multiple offers .

73df16c85afd837cad83f559883f17d077ac51d4,"Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it. In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying: 'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking. 'When I walked out of that doctor's surgery I felt so much better just at having told people about it.'","Comedian Dave Hughes called Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on Monday's Q&A .

b0c8b68ef3dfb64b19cc3787e54693f4dd12b5e3,"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member  bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year, details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.","Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Labour leader Ed Miliband .

eeaadebf0fc8512031f7b509b236024fd8e7060e,"Melbourne, Australia (CNN)A man stands on a beach in a distant land. Waves lap his ankles. He wades through the gentle dawn light, arms outstretched, his head held high. He is fully dressed; not a tourist but a freedom fighter. A photograph of this man, beamed around the world, becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty. It is 2015. The man is Peter Greste. If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli, such is the power of persuasion. It's easy to lead a horse to water when, in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance. The sum total of television programming, beer advertising, political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of Australia's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation: young (white) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead. Last weekend I planted Gallipoli rosemary in my backyard; part of the proceeds go to the Avenues of Honour, a national project to preserve and restore Australia's living memorials. More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game. To widen the scope of historical tribute, and also recall the words and deeds of the Australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment, is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive. But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Even at the time, the Great War itself was divisive, a historical reality belied by today's bland, blanket coverage of ""the Anzac spirit"". Australia's participation in the war was contested from the outset. On August 11, 1914, veteran political campaigner Vida Goldstein wrote in her Woman Voter newspaper: ""It is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of Christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict."" As she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage, Goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words. ""The time has come for women to show that they, as givers of life, refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter."" Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. ""The enfranchised women of Australia are political units in the British Empire,"" Goldstein argued, ""and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts."" Goldstein's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Under the newly legislated War Precautions Act, the Woman Voter suffered censorship, leading Goldstein and her Women's Peace Army to fight on multiple fronts: ""We are fighting for Civil Liberty and against Military Despotism.""  Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to ""the capitalist war"" joined the movement. Australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the Allied forces; less than 40% of eligible men signed up to fight ""for King and Country."" As the carnage at Gallipoli brought home the realities of war, recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread. General strikes halted industry, as workers reacted to the food shortages, unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of ""the Working Man's Paradise."" With enlistments falling away in 1916, Prime Minister Billy Hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the Unlawful Associations Act. Groups that voiced opposition to the war, like the International Workers of the World, were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material ""likely to cause disaffection or alarm"". When waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike, the War Precautions Act was invoked to send them back to work. In September 1916, the Sydney Twelve were arrested and tried for treason. ""Fifteen years for 15 words"" was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment. The conscription referendums of October 28, 1916, and December 20, 1917, became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war — or the federal government's domestic policies. There were diverse reasons for that opposition, including the anti-British sentiments of Irish Catholic Australians. In Melbourne, the meeting place for such public debate was Yarra Bank, a pocket of land nestled between what today is Birrarung Marr and the Rod Laver Arena. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River. Most protest meetings were peaceful, but one became infamously violent. ""Riotous scenes at Yarra Bank"", headlines around the nation proclaimed, when a demonstration organized by the Women's Peace Army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers. Both conscription referendums ultimately failed. The Australian Dictionary of Biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists, many of whom went to jail, including Vida Goldstein's compatriots Adela Pankhurst and Jennie Baines. Baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at Yarra Bank in 1918. She is reputedly the first Australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike. Other protesters were deported. As historian Janet Butler reminds us: ""It does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide."" The enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of Gallipoli, manifested not only in the ""shattered Anzacs"" whose families bore the burden of care, but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped Australia's social and political relations in the 20th century. Lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech — were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much, but are still accorded little recognition. Perhaps, by the 125th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives, we will come to associate riverbanks, as well as beaches, with the potent ebb and flow of freedom.

Tom Richards, 25, was arrested yesterday morning in his home city of Swansea. After being held in a cell for 11 hours, the cage fighter was bailed at 7pm as police continue their investigation. It comes after Westbrook, 41, made claims on social media that her younger former lover had been violent towards her, posting a photograph on Twitter of her bruised hand. The pair were last seen together at an Essex pub last month (above) after splitting up in November . It comes after the 41-year-old accused her younger former boyfriend of violence online. She was seen last month with a black-eye. Richards strenuously denies the allegations and has not been charged . Richards, who is an MMA fighter, has vehemently denied the allegations against him. The pair split in November last year after spending months together in California while Westbrook tried to rid herself of drugs. Speaking of his arrest yesterday, a spokesman for Richards said there was 'no truth' behind the allegations. 'There is no truth in these allegations and we will be challenging them.' The couple split in November after spending months together in California . Police arrested Richards in Swansea yesterday morning on suspicion of physically attacking his former girlfriend in Essex. While denying ever harassing or harming his former girlfriend, a spokesman added being arrested had been 'upsetting' for Richards. 'He is training for a fight and could do without the distraction.

751f6154994bf71e246ee9197ba7d099f2005dac,"In an unprecedented move, Russia has cancelled the release of a Hollywood thriller set in the Stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.","Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Hollywood's Child 44 .

aaba512f0e130084d17c2bed96296a960b473783,"Wealth: Training consultant Jay Rutland, 34, with his 30-year-old billionaire wife Tamara Ecclestone . The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £65 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just £3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant’s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing ‘management consultancy activities’. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £3,378, down from £18,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a £45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £7million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia’s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £70,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone’s family is worth an estimated £3billion - and the couple are said to own a £300,000 Ferrari, £123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a £100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: ‘Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.’ Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a £50,000 Rolex and a £20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence. MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts.","Jay Rutland, 34, is married to 30-year-old daughter of Bernie Ecclestone .

d28e5266dcf52af8640fb349af8deffc75372047,"Chelsea will try to add another trophy to their ever-expanding cabinet when the Under 19 team take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the final of the UEFA Youth League on Monday afternoon. Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday . Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland . REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS .

While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we’re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It’s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It’s not unusual for a client to ask “how many followers does she have?” before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a ‘cool girl’ with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it’s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don’t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has 1.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5’8, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.","Australian model agencies reveal new demand for social media following .

Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released ""pending further inquiries,"" Australia's Federal Police said. Sevdet Besim, 18, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The person charged Monday is accused of conspiring to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. ""The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,"" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the ""Daesh death cult,"" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men ""are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,"" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. ""I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men,"" Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said. ""And this is an issue not just with law enforcement, but for the broader community. ... We need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior, at the very early stage.""

But Malia Obama isn't your average 16-year-old: Her driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service.

Scroll down for video . Famous family: Malia Obama, seen with her mother Michelle Obama in April 2009, reportedly was taught how to drive by Secret Service agents .

The full interview is set to air Thursday. Mrs. Obama hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years, she said. She added that driving gives Malia 'a sense of normalcy,' helping her feel like the rest of her friends who are also driving. 'And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids.'

Malia also drives herself around Washington, Mrs. Obama said. 'She always has security around but in order for her to learn how to drive she had to drive on her own,' the first lady said during a separate interview on 'Live!

78b8cbcd59ba74d2e6ba11770431414a296af0fc,"A 7ft 8in tall man  so embarrassed by his height he hid at home for 'half his life' has found love with a woman three feet smaller than him. Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28, developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for years. But true  happiness eventually found the shy Brazilian - who has come to be known as 'the gentle giant' - in the form of Evem Medeiros, a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online. Scroll down for video . Half his size: Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28 (right), who at 7ft 8in tall has come to be known as 'the gentle giant', married Evem Medeiros (left), a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online . 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size.' The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life. 'I get asked a lot about this and at first it annoyed me but nowadays it's normal and I am used to it. I take it in good humour,' explained the real-life Goliath. 'Some people like to talk about my shoe size and then imagine how big my member might be. 'I think the size of my feet is false advertising. Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: 'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. 'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I'd always have to go and buy more and more. 'I thought ""there’s something wrong here"" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn’t stopped. True love: 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size' Joelison's mother added: 'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. 'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn’t see him. 'I was really worried.' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn't want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have 'adapted to' With the gigantism under control, Joelison's confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil's tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison's mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she's found it hard to adjust to her son's wife, claiming, 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him' 'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,' said Joelison. 'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. 'She is very caring. She doesn't show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.' Just a year later they were married and it didn't take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. 'I had a certain amount of fear,' she said. 'I was afraid it wouldn't work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.' She added: 'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. 'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don't ovulate. I've done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. 'But he hasn't done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem's polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison's height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn’t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. 'With his treatment, I’m still the one who takes care of that, I haven’t delegated it to that girl yet. 'But I will once she gets used to things.' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home. On top of this, he is soon due to fly to a Paris convention where he will meet others with gigantism, including the tallest man in the world, Sultan Kösen from Turkey. And Joelison, who is thought to be the third tallest man in the world, says he is looking forward to the novelty of being smaller than someone for once. 'The most interesting thing is going to be standing face to face with someone,' he said. 'The last time I did that I was a child.'

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either ‘incredibly naive or totally incompetent’ by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank’s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for ‘a further one-year period’ before leaving the bank’s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that ‘no decision has been taken at this time’. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: ‘You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.’ Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC’s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined £1.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than £500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC’s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC’s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that ‘frontline’ staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank’s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: ‘We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.’ But Mrs Hodge responded that to ‘simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose’. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.","Criticised over 'incompetent' handling of bank's tax evasion scandal .

When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She’s owned up to it.

Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she’s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn’t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this.

Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.'

Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports.

At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

Officials from the anti-racism body say they have acted on complaints from some Hartlepool fans and urged Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who might decide to 'black up' for the occasion. Jamaican reggae artist Marley was a multi-million-selling artist, famed for his music and as a Rastafarian for his dreadlocked look, who died of cancer aged 36 in 1981. Hartlepool United fans have a history of fancy dress, travelling as the Smurfs to Charlton in 2012 . Hartlepool fans are planning to dress up as Bob Marley for the final game of this season at Carlisle . A statement from Kick It Out read: 'We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool United supporters about the Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club's fans for their fixture against Carlisle United at Brunton Park on Saturday 2 May. 'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture . 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.' Neither Carlisle nor Hartlepool were immediately available for comment but Carlisle boss Keith Curle told the local News & Star at a press conference this week: 'I've been to fancy dress parties when white people have dressed up as Bob Marley.

2b82bcda3b1d21e6afde258bdfd1c7de293f58f4,"They like to play a bit of Queen at Bournemouth’s little home in the minutes before their matches start. They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth’s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday’s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth’s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: ‘It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, “Don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’t want them to have any more”.’ Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth’s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham — the only goal of the match — Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. ‘No-one will blame Adam,’ Howe said. ‘We will tell him how much we love him tonight.’ Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt ‘heartbroken’. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs £1 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth’s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. ‘He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,’ he said. ‘We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.’ But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of £120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It’s crazy but it’s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill.

691bac0b53a908837ea2ef0d2d7c5c4e5c3a43d2,"A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, ""Wow!""' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.","Skin Laundry, a trendy new skin clinic in Manhattan, offers a ten-minute laser facial which promises to tighten skin .

Ozil was off the pace at the beginning of this season, but says he is now back to his best since returning to fitness in January. And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule. Mesut Ozil trains ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi final against Reading on Saturday . The German star says he is now playing his best football since joining the Gunners in the summer of 2013 . Ozil said 10 years of playing football had taken their toll, but he has come to terms with the Premier League . Mesut Ozil is interviewed in this week's Sport . 'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him. 'I was exhausted at the start of the season,' he confesses. 'I started playing professional football at the age of 16 and had never really suffered many serious injuries. ' I guess 10 years of consistently playing football took its toll. I was also struggling with the physicality of this league.' However, Ozil has bounced back in the second half of this season, his excellent form coinciding with a winning run that has seen the Gunners climb the table. And the 26-year-old midfielder has attributed his success, in part, to the injury that kept him out for three months this winter. Ozil celebrates scoring a goal in the convincing win against Liverpool, when he was in excellent form . Ozil has put his improved performances down to the strength training he went through after being injured . 'The injury worked in my favour in a way, as it gave me time to recover, to assess and to work on what was required to compete in this league,' he added. 'The football here is far more physical, it is played at a faster tempo and you have to adapt to the sheer number of games. 'I have had to work a lot harder and adjust my game accordingly. I used my time out with injury to work on my strength. I'm continuing to do extra sessions after training now.'

dd7200d8975b2f30512d4b813b123b8d54330b47,"A former mob enforcer in Rhode Island with ties to late New England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca has died in a federal prison in North Carolina. Gerard T. 'The Frenchman' Ouimette was 75. The Federal Bureau of Prison's website reported that Ouimette, who had lived in Fall River, Massachusetts, died Sunday. Ouimette, suspected of having a role in up to eight murders, 'ran' the federal prison in North Carolina in the 1970s and even had booze, drugs and lobster dinner smuggled in on a weekly basis, according to a Rhode Island State Police report. His nephew, Kevin Ouimette Lynch, tells the Providence Journal that his uncle was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and died in his sleep at a prison in Butner, North Carolina. Ouimette was reportedly in control of a gangster network responsible for gambling, loansharking, extortion, and murder, among other crimes . Ouimette passed away in this medium security facility after being diagnosed with lung cancer . In 1996, Ouimette was convicted of extortion and became the first criminal in New England sentenced to life in prison under the federal 'three strikes and you're out' provision for violent offenders. Ouimette had more than 10 convictions during his criminal career, including one for punching an FBI agent. The Providence Journal reports that Ouimette spent a total of 46 years behind bars. A 1979 FBI document regarding his background paints the picture of man in control of a massive underworld network. 'Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries,' the report states. Ouimette had close ties to crime boss Raymond Patriarca, seen here leaving a federal building in Boston on June 27, 1967. 'Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and New England area.' The document went on to call Ouimette responsible for 'seven of eight gangland-style murders.' He was never convicted of any homicides, however. Ouimette was known to his associates as 'The Frenchman.' In his 2012 memoir, 'What Price Providence,' the enforcer blamed the police for the nickname. ''The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood,' he wrote. 'Due to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.' In the introduction to that back, he wrote that he knew he would die in prison. 'There is a saying that is appropriate to prison life: 'If you sit by the river long enough, you will eventually see all your enemies float by,'' he wrote. 'Bottom line is, if you can survive, you're ahead of the game, not by much, but by some. The reason is, there is no room for error when you are playing the La Costra Nostra's major leagues; one mistake can end your life, and often does.' The gangland enforcer's influence was not diminished behind bars, and state police said he even became the boss of the ACI's maxium security prison in the 1970s. At least once a week in the latter years of that decade, gang associate Charles 'The Ghost' Kennedy would visit the facility with as much as $600 worth of alcohol, marijuana, ham, cold cuts, cheese, and Italian bread for security guards to deliver to the incarcerated Ouimette and his gang. They even had catered lobster dinners, police said. Ouimette, then 55, is seen here being escorted out of Federal Court in Providence, Rhode Island, after being sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 . Besides booze, Ouimette even once had his son, then only five-years-old, smuggled into the prison for a sleepover, the Journal reported. Eventually he and Kennedy had a falling out, and Kennedy claimed a hit squad was assembled to kill him. A fearful man, during his 1996 exortion trial several strippers who were called to testify about threats Ouimette had made in their club broke down in tears before him in court. Ouimette's body will be sent back to Rhode Island where Ouimette will be buried.","Gerard T. Ouimette, 75, known as 'The Frenchman,' died in medium security federal pen in his sleep .

5bf656b9bc77d95d009faa17ea8cee6abf64b5d1,"Jamie Carragher says Mike Ashley has turned Newcastle United into a ‘boring’ club and has accused the billionaire owner of only being interested in making money. His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs – a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of ‘We’re rich but our team is s***’ and ‘Where’s the money gone?’ in protest at Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million and later revealed they have £34m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. ‘I can understand why fans are frustrated,’ said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. ‘It’s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there’s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they’ve been. They think “Where else can I make money? Oh a football club”. ‘I’ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it’s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. ‘So he’s balanced the books - he’s made money because he’s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. ‘Now it’s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club’s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . ‘I think you’ve got to get the balance right. It’s not just about making money,’ he said. ‘Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn’t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn’t work. ‘Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. ‘To reconnect has to be the best way forward.’ Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .","Jamie Carragher has slammed Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley .

af607233559f42e897f7c8d5ef44cd112715d955,"Two men who claim they were molested as young boys by Michael Jackson are expected to find out on Tuesday if they will be allowed to sue  for a slice of the late King Of Pop's $1.5 billion estate. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and ­instigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the ­filings. The singer regularly dressed Safe­chuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.","Wade Robson and James Safechuck hope to find out on Tuesday if they can bring a civil lawsuit against the late singer's estate .

1ae7d8c3af1fa0b0a0a7d9fcb61b21336188ee8c,"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.","Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .

Residents of rural towns like Cumnock, Errowanbang and Molong in NSW and Wicheproof in Victoria hope the bargain rentals will entice families with young children who can help populate their schools, save the local bus run and keep businesses open. Cumnock resident Christine Weston says the Rent-a-farmhouse initiative she set up in 2008 brought new life to her town of 280 people near Orange The town's population increased 30 per cent but those families are growing up and moving on. 'Country life still appeals to many families, but it doesn’t always make financial sense for them. We’re trying to change that,' Ms Westone told the Daily Telegraph.

Scarlett's parents helped renovate the old 'Barina' homestead while renting the property for $1 a week . This farmhouse in Wycheproof, a wheat town  northwest of Melbourne, was leased for $1 a week in a bid to boost enrolments at the  local school and sports club . 'We offer $1 rent on the condition that the families who move in have kids, but can also contribute to bush communities with skills we’re short of,' Ms Weston said. Ms Weston says some farmhouses are being offered at  low rent because they need renovating. Others need a caretaker to look after the farm and some need skilled labour to help during busy harvest times and others need children to save the school bus run. Everyone is welcome to apply. The Mercer's country home called 'Barina' which is part of the Rentafarmhouse scheme . Cumnock was the first town to implement the Rentafarmhouse project but more than 20 rural communities from WA, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW have benefited from taking part in similar $1-a-week schemes. The sheep shearing town of Errowanbang, near Orange, saw its school enrolments increase 300 per cent after  residents started leasing properties to new families for next to nothing. In Rugby, 200kms south-west of Sydney, a school was saved. Its student  numbers had dwindled to two. Some of the $1-a-week farmhouses are rundown and in need of renovation, others need a caretaker for the farm or children in the community to keep local schools running .

8dd78a23332abf9deedc69370cda8960f0c39a30,"Robbie Knievel has been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in Butte, Montana - the town his daredevil father Evel Knievel helped make famous. Knievel, 52, was speeding in an SUV on Tuesday evening when he rear-ended a Honda, causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, police said. No one was injured. After the crash, Knievel drove off but his car was found nearby and he was seen walking about a block away, according to Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich. In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon: American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride … that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.","The daredevil, 52, 'was speeding in an SUV when he rear-ended a car and set off a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles on Tuesday'

a587bd4ad3b944a599468d9afb5c2ec54ae10994,"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman.

The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Locals from the Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claim they saw a low-flying jet on the morning MH370 disappeared .

Since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full-time triathlete, I've been juggling training life with a full-time job, hectic commute and time with friends and family. With my Fit Nation teammates spread far and wide, this was a solo effort. Throw in a notorious Chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night, and I'll admit it: I was not very diligent in getting all of my training done. ""Partner up,"" the Facebook status read. Jae Rockwell, the founder of my local women's fitness groups, Women RUN the World, posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable. And so that's what I did. I'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends. So, I reached out to them to ask what they were up to. Annastasia W., who's training for her first Ironman half-triathlon this summer, suggested a group brick workout at our local gym. She invited several other women, including complete newbies, through the SoleTri Sisters Facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold Chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes, bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes. That was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week. A few weeks later, I traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, to run a marathon. I traveled to Little Rock with three phenomenal ""fitspirations"": Samantha Goga, Natali Villarruel and Umber Rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the Midwest Vikings. Seeing how much fun they've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon! Swimming remains my weakest link. I just learned to swim last summer. Sometimes I forget that and don't cut myself any slack or recognize how far I've come. Once my formal swim class ended in February I found myself seriously slacking on my swim training. Enter my swim angels, Lovie Twine and Eanista Bailey. They took me out into Lake Michigan last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory ""swim"" (which was really just wading). It was great to have them join me for a swim workout. I appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching. And you know what was happening while I was partnering up? Spring was on the way! And that meant I could finally break free of my Computrainer bike sessions and hit the road. I was lucky enough to connect with the Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago (MTC3) for a series of novice rides they've been hosting on local trails around Chicagoland. With two falls behind me (hey, those clips take some getting used to), we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born. Riding outside with the wind whipping your face, chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and I'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors. I want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that I've been lucky enough to find. There are so many others we keep me inspired, accountable and motivated. I'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and I hope that I can help others do the same. So when times get tough, partner up!",Working out in a group of friends inspired Fit Nation participant Erica Moore .

The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: ‘There was definitely a lot of, ""Oh, you’re going to lose what’s special about you. You’re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.""' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It’s good. We’re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn’t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries – something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's new 'See The Real Me' campaign.

dfea7a09613642f43b58623e0557bfeb8fccc1bd,"(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.   Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again. James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that ""continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."" Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it.  This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation.  EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. First, EPA's ""Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan"" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan.  This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050. EPA's implementation modeling, ""Option 1 -- State,""  shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050.  In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer. Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants.  The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free. Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others. Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050.  This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement. This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order ""Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,"" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors. While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there.  The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.","U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe: Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity .
So why doesn't the President's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, do more with nuclear power?"

Since announcing his intention to retire in February, McCoy has enjoyed a farewell tour up and down the country as well as travelling over to Ireland, with the attendance at usually mundane midweek meetings boosted by his presence. The adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue, McCoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top. Tony McCoy holds the jockeys championship trophy he won for the 20th  time on the day he retires . Northern Irishman McCoy shows his emotion at Sandown Park after the final race of his career . McCoy says the response to his retirement announcement has made his final months in the saddle easier . Speaking to At The Races on the first morning he could no longer call himself a jockey he said: 'We had a very good night but I've just got up and haven't got round to eating breakfast yet. I can smell it, though, and someone has done the right thing and cooked me a nice breakfast. 'It was very difficult to take it all in yesterday, the crowd, the people round the parade ring, the great racing public came out in force and I was very flattered and honoured by it all. 'To get a reception like that for doing something I've loved to do for pretty much all my life, I'm really going to miss it. 'I told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you're doing it because the end comes quickly. 'It's very nice to feel that I have the respect of people up and down the country. For the last 21 years I've ridden up and down the country pretty much full on but over the last two and a half months people have come out to give me a wonderful welcome and I'm very grateful of that. 'It would be very difficult not to notice how that has developed and I'd like to thank all those people for coming out and making the last few months of my career so special and making it a little bit easier.

McCoy stands with his wife Chanelle and children Eve and Archie with the trophy he's won 20 times in a row . McCoy waves goodbye to the fans who line the fence and pack the racecourse to see his final ride . McCoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at Sandown but his agent Dave Roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells. 'When I decided to retire I always thought I'd go to Sandown on the last day and say 'thanks very much' but having spoken to Dave, he said I was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt, for my own piece of mind, to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring,' he said. 'We also felt it might be a good thing for racing, people probably deserved to know. 'I thought it would die down but it never really did and those are things I'll remember for ever. When I looked around yesterday, as difficult as it was it helped me realise I'd made the right decision.' 'If I'd carried on and maybe not been as good as I was a lot of these people might not have come out. It's hard to say it but it is probably the right decision. 'I feel satisfied through what has happened with my life but I've also said I'd love another go because I feel I could still do it better than anybody! 'I never felt like I did a day's work in my life, I've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and I'm very proud of what I've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen, I was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time. 'The owners, the trainers, the lads, the horses, I could go on all day thanking people. McCoy said he thought he could retire quietly but is glad he's had the chance to farewell racing properly . Sandown Park was packed out for the champion jockey's finale on Saturday in Esher . McCoy said there were 'a lot' of things he would miss about racing but also some aspects of the tough sport that he will be happy to see the back of. 'Like spending a lot of time in a hospital and ringing doctors begging for help to make me better,' he said. 'Obviously my wife Chanelle wanted me to retire but at the same time I knew myself it was the right time for my family, my mum and dad are in their 70s now and don't enjoy watching me as much any more because of the dangers involved so it certainly makes their life easier. 'I never thought of the dangers and when I got injured I felt I was unlucky and it wouldn't happen again but I know the dangers and they first became apparent to me when I was at Toby Balding's and Richard Davies died and just lately you only need to see what happened to John Thomas (McNamara) and Robbie McNamara.'","AP McCoy rode in his last races on Saturday at Sandown Park .

Not knowing when the car might burst into full flame, they scrambled to save her, while a police dash cam rolled. CNN obtained the footage from affiliate WPIX. Kinnelon Police Officers Mark Ehrenburg and Ricky Ferriola cut the seat belt from her, then dragged the woman's limp body away from the crash to start emergency medical care. Not a minute later, flames licked out of the car. Two more minutes -- an explosion. All three were lucky to escape the flames. The rescue started when someone reported an erratic driver on Thursday, and the officers sped off to investigate. When they pulled up at the scene, the 2006 Toyota Solara convertible was already a smoking wreck. Its horn was blaring. The officers ran over to the flipped over car, and shouted over the honking horn at the driver, ""Can you hear me?"" No response, not even a gesture, the video showed. It took them two minutes to cut off the seat belt, as smoke kept rising. Once they had her in safety, the officers hooked the driver up to a defibrillator and started CPR. The woman, identified by the Kinnelon Police Department as Dawn Milosky, 45, of Beachwood, New Jersey, was airlifted to Morristown Medical Center and survived. She's been charged with driving while intoxicated, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle, reckless driving and with failure to stay in her lane, according to WPIX. Kinnelon Police Sgt. Chris Carbone told WPIX that they released the video to show that the driver may have died, if others had not informed the police. As for his colleagues' bravery, he said, ""A lot of times, we don't think of our own safety doing this job.""

5263cf68d7257a29a34facfc295ba162318c62ea,"Field Marshall Erwin Rommel sporting his famous goggles which were in fact a five from British Major General Michael Gambier-Parry . He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa. Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, also became an iconic wartime figure – and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth. Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time. They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat. Major General Michael Gambier-Parry, of the 2nd Armoured Division, was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili, Libya, in 1941. The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie. The pair shared good wine and smoked ‘excellent cigars’, according to Gambier-Parry’s granddaughter, Liza Donoghue, 67. During the meal, Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat. A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner. And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry’s Army goggles in a staff car, he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed. Scroll down for video .

Rommel committed suicide in October 1944 after taking part in a failed plot to kill Hitler. Mrs Donoghue, of Bristol, said of her grandfather: ‘He respected Rommel. He always said that he was a fair general.’ The goggles are now housed in a museum dedicated to Rommel in Herrlingen, Germany.","Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, became an iconic wartime figure .

'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said the Iraqi leader did not make a specific request for additional military support during the meeting. President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS . 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS. Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becomingprime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meantto convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has soughtto be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq . Vice President Joe Biden, left,  and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'","Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit to the Oval Office .

Sharon Edwards' car was left parked in her driveway and the clothes she had been wearing on March 14 were thrown in the washing basket in her bedroom. Her son, Eli Edwards, told Daily Mail Australia his family was struggling to come to terms with his mother's disappearance. Sharon Edwards, 55, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday March 14 in Grafton, NSW . Pictured from left: Her son Zac, husband John, son Eli, Ms Edwards and her third son Josh . ‘The worst part is not knowing anything, it’s such a mystery,’ he said. ‘My old man’s taking it pretty hard and I guess we are all just going through stages.’ There was no sign of forced entry at her Grafton home on the NSW north coast and it has left her family with many unanswered questions. Ms Edwards, a 55-year-old teacher, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on March 14 after spending the afternoon with close friends at the nearby Good Intent Hotel. Her wallet and handbag are missing but she has not accessed any of her bank or social media accounts. She is not believed to have had any enemies, but as Ms Edwards has no history of mental illness police are treating the investigation as a homicide.

Sharon Edwards, 54, posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . ‘We can’t think of anyone that would want to do anything to hurt her. We don’t have any theories,’ he said. Police and family say they hold 'grave concerns' for her welfare as it is extremely out of character. After police made it known they were investigating foul play, Mr Edwards said his family started to face the harsh reality that his mother may never be coming home. ‘It could be a real possibility and I guess after all this time it feels like there is really only one outcome left.’ Mr Edwards said regardless of how it happens, he wants his mum brought home. 'I want her to be found, one way or another.' 'We just need an outcome, at least that way we can all have some closure,’ he added. It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . She has no known medical conditions and has not made contact with relatives. Mr Edwards said he and his fiance sometimes worked weekends and his mother was due to come to Brisbane to help care for his young daughter. ‘She wouldn't miss that for the world,’ Mr Edwards explained.

As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast . Reading defender Nathaniel Chaloboah (left) chases Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) on Saturday . Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final . Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent — David Jones did the job — but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is. The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable. The BBC may miss out on the Premier League's pricey weekly thrills, but took the biscuit on Saturday. The BBC's Dan Walker talks pitchside with Sportsmail's Martin Keown at Wembley .
